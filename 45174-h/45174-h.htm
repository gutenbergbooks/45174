<h2 id='ch01' class='c005'><i>Chapter I</i><br />Â <br />OUT OF THE NORTHEAST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"Hi, there, young lady!"</p>

<p>"Hi, yourself,--what d'you want?"</p>

<p>At the water's edge, a girl of sixteen
stopped in the act of launching a small
skiff. She straightened her lithe figure and
faced about, her brown hair blowing in
the breeze, turning a pair of snapping grey
eyes inquiringly upon the young man who
walked down the beach toward her.</p>

<p>"Miss Dixon, isn't it?" asked the
stranger, his deeply tanned features breaking
into an engaging smile. "I'm not sure
I recognized you at first in the bathing
suit--"</p>

<p>"No matter how you were dressed I'm
sure I wouldn't recognize you," returned
Dorothy, shortly. "I've never laid eyes on
you before--that's why."</p>

<p>The young man laughed. "Quite right,"
he said, "you haven't. But I happen to be
a near neighbor of yours, and I've seen
you."</p>

<p>"Up at New Canaan?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dad has taken the Hawthorne
place,--bought it in fact."</p>

<p>For a full minute the girl stared at this
tall young man with the blonde hair and
the jolly smile. Surprise left her speechless.</p>

<p>Then--"Why--why--" she gasped.
"Y-you must be the famous Bill Bolton!"</p>

<p>"Bolton's the name, all right," he
grinned. "But that famous stuff is the
bunk."</p>

<p>Dorothy was herself again, and a little
ashamed of her burst of feeling.</p>

<p>"But you <i>are</i> the aviator!" She went on,
more calmly. "My father told me the other
day that you and your father were coming
to live across the road from us. And I
don't mind telling you we're simply
thrilled! You see, I've read about you in
the papers--and I know all about the wonderful
things you've done!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you've got an exaggerated
idea--it was all in the day's work, you
know," protested the blonde-headed young
man, his eyebrows slanting quizzically,
"I'm Bill Bolton, but I didn't barge in on
you to talk about myself. You're starting
out for a sail in that sloop that's moored
over there, I take it?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I am. Want to come along?"</p>

<p>"Thanks a lot. I've got a business
matter to attend to down here in a few minutes."
He hesitated a moment, then--"I
know it's none of my affair, but don't you
think it's rather risky to go for a sail just
now?"</p>

<p>Dorothy shrugged. "Oh, I don't know.
There's a two reef breeze blowing out beyond
the Point, but that's nothing to worry
about. I've sailed all over Long Island
Sound since I was a kid, and I've been out
in worse blows than this, lots of times."</p>

<p>"Maybe," countered Bill. "Storm warnings
were broadcast about an hour ago.
We're in for a northeaster--"</p>

<p>She broke in scoffingly--"Oh! those
weathermen! They're always wrong. It's
a perfectly scrumptious afternoon. The
storm, if it comes, will probably show up
sometime tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"Well," he retorted, "you're your own
boss, I suppose.--If you were my sister,"
he added suddenly, "you wouldn't go sailing
today."</p>

<p>"Then it's a good thing I'm <i>not</i> your sister.
Thanks for your interest," she
mocked. There was a hint of anger in her
voice at the suspicion that Bill Bolton was
trying to patronize her. "Don't worry,"
she added, resuming her usual tone, "I can
handle a boat--Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Their eyes met; Bill's gravely accusing,
hers, full of defiant determination.</p>

<p>"Good-bye--sorry I spoke." Bill
turned away and walked up the beach toward
the club house.</p>

<p>Dorothy chuckled when she saw him
throw a quick glance over his shoulder.
She waved her hand, but he kept on without
appearing to notice the friendly gesture.</p>

<p>"A temper goes with that blond hair,"
she said to herself, digging a bare heel into
the loose shingle. "I guess I was pretty
rude, though. But what right had he to
talk like that? Bill Bolton may be a famous
aviator, but he's only a year older than I
am."</p>

<p>She ran the skiff out through the shallows
and sprang aboard. Standing on the
stern thwart she sculled the small craft
forward with short, strong strokes, and
presently nosed alongside the <i>Scud</i>. As
she boarded the sloop and turned with the
skiff's painter in her hand she caught sight
of Bill getting into an open roadster on the
club driveway.</p>

<p>"I guess he meant well," she observed
to the wavelets that lapped the side of the
<i>Scud</i>, "but just the same--well, that's
that."</p>

<p>Making the painter secure to a cleat in
the stern, she set about lacing a couple of
reefs into the mainsail. Having tied the
last reef-point, she loosened the skiff's
painter, pulled the boat forward and skillfully
knotted the rope to the sloop's mooring.
Then she cast off the mooring altogether
and ran aft to her place at the tiller.</p>

<p>The <i>Scud's</i> head played off. Dorothy,
as she had told Bill, was no novice at the
art of small boat sailing. With her back
bracing the tiller she ran up the jib and
twisted the halyard to a cleat close at hand.</p>

<p>Then as the sloop gained steerageway,
she pulled on the peak and throat halyards
until the reefed-down mainsail was setting
well. The <i>Scud</i>, a fast twenty-footer, was
rigged with a fore-staysail and gaff-topsail
as well, but Dorothy knew better than to
break them out in a wind like this.</p>

<p>As it was she carried all the canvas her
little boat would stand, and they ran out
past the Point, which acted as a breakwater
to the yacht club inlet, with the starboard
gunwale well awash. The wind out here
stiffened perceptibly and Dorothy wished
she had tied in three reefs instead of two before
starting. Her better judgment told
her to go about and seek the quieter waters
of the inlet. But here, pride took a hand.</p>

<p>If she turned back and gave up her afternoon
sail, the next time she saw Bill Bolton
she must admit he had been right. No.
That would never do.</p>

<p>Although the wind out here was stiffer
than she had imagined, this was no northeast
gale; a good three-reef breeze, that
was all. So lowering the peak slightly she
continued to head her little craft offshore.</p>

<p>The <i>Scud</i> fought and bucked like a wild
thing, deluging Dorothy with spray. She
gloried in the tug of the tiller, the sting of
the salt breeze, the dance of her craft over
choppy seas. Glistening in the clear summer
sunlight, flecked with tiny whitecaps,
the landlocked water stretched out to where
the low hills of Long Island banked the
horizon in a blur of purple and green.</p>

<p>Now and then as she luffed into a particularly
strong gust, Dorothy had her
misgivings. But pride, confidence in her
ability to handle her boat and the thrill of
danger kept her going.</p>

<p>She had been sailing for about an hour,
beating her way eastward with the Connecticut
shore four or five miles off her
port quarter, when all at once, somehow,
she felt a change. The sunshine seemed
less brilliant, the shadows less solid, less
sharply outlined. It seemed as if a very
thin gauze had been drawn across the sun
dimming without obscuring it. Dorothy
searched the sky in vain to discover the
smallest shred of cloud.</p>

<p>At the same time the breeze slackened
and the air, which had been stimulant and
quick with oxygen seemed to become thick,
sluggish, suffocating. Presently, the <i>Scud</i>
was lying becalmed, while the ground
swell, long and perfectly smooth, set sagging
jib and mainsail flapping. Except
for the rattling of the blocks and the creaking
of the boom, the silence, after the whistling
wind of a few minutes before, was
tremendously oppressive.</p>

<p>Then in the distance there was a low
growl of thunder. In a moment came a
louder, angrier growl--as if the first were
a menace which had not been heeded. But
the first growl was quite enough for
Dorothy. She knew what was coming and
let go her halyards, bringing down her
sails with a run. Now fully alive to the
danger, she raced to her work of making
the little craft secure to meet the oncoming
storm.</p>

<p>She was gathering in the mainsail, preparatory
to furling it when there was a
violent gust of wind, cold, smelling of the
forests from which it came, corrugating
the steely surface of the Sound. Two or
three big raindrops fell--and then, the
deluge.</p>

<p>Dorothy rushed to a locker, pulled out
a slicker and sou'wester and donned them.
Returning to her place by the tiller, she
watched the rain. Rain had never rained
so hard, she thought. Already both the
Connecticut and Long Island shores were
completely blotted out, hidden behind
walls of water. The big drops pelted the
Sound like bullets, sending up splashes
bigger than themselves.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the wind came tearing
across the inland sea from out the northeast.
Thunder crashed, roared, reverberated.
Lightning slashed through the black
cloud-canopy in long, blinding zigzags.
The wind moaned, howled, shrieked, immense
in its wild force, immense in its
reckless fury.</p>

<p>A capsized sloop wallowed in the
trough of heavy seas rearing a dripping
keel skyward--and to this perilous perch
clung Dorothy.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch02' class='c007'><i>Chapter II</i><br />Â <br />TAXI!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The black brush of storm had long ago
painted out the last vestige of daylight.</p>

<p>Crouching on the upturned hull of her
sloop, Dorothy clung to the keel with
nerveless fingers, while the <i>Scud</i> wallowed
in an angry sea laced with foam and spray.
She knew that in a little while the boat
must sink, and that in water like this even
the strongest swimmer must quickly succumb.
Cold, wet and helpless, Dorothy
anxiously scanned her narrow horizon,
but in vain.</p>

<p>For another half hour she hung on in
the rain and darkness, battered by heavy
combers that all but broke her hold. She
was fast losing her nerve and with it the
willingness to struggle. Phantom shapes
reached toward her from the gloom.
Strange lights danced before her eyes....</p>

<p>With a rolling lurch the <i>Scud</i> sank, and
Dorothy found herself fighting the waves
unsupported. The shock of sudden immersion
brought back her scattering wits,
but the delusion of dancing lights still held;
especially one light, larger and brighter
than the others. Surely this one was real
and not the fantasy of an overwrought
imagination!</p>

<p>Half smothered in flying spume, the
drowning girl made one last frantic effort
to keep afloat. Above the pounding of the
sea, a throbbing roar shook her eardrums,
a glare of light followed by a huge dark
form swooped down as if to crush her--and
she lost consciousness.</p>

<p>Dorothy awoke in a darkness so complete
that for a moment she thought her
eyes must be bandaged. Nervous fingers
soon found that this was not the case, and
reaching out, they came in contact with a
light switch.</p>

<p>The sudden gleam of the electrics half
blinded her. Presently she saw that she
lay on a narrow bunk in a cabin. Presumably
she was aboard a vessel, still out
in the storm, for the ship pitched and rolled
like a drunken thing, and the roar of a
powerful exhaust was deafening.</p>

<p>Someone had removed her sweater, had
tucked warm blankets about her body.
Her throat burned from a strong stimulant
which apparently had been administered
while she was unconscious.</p>

<p>For some minutes she lay there taking in
her surroundings. The charts tacked to
the cabin walls, the tiny electric cookstove,
hinged table and armsrack opposite. Listlessly
she counted the weapons, four rifles,
three shotguns, two automatics--and fastened
in its own niche was a machine gun
covered with a waterproof jacket. A complete
arsenal.... The shotguns bespoke
sportsmen, but this was neither the season
for duck nor for snipe. Men did not go
shooting in Long Island Sound with rifles,
revolvers and a machine gun.... <i>Bootleggers!</i></p>

<p>It came to her like a bolt from the blue.
She was on board a rumrunner, no less,
and notwithstanding the exhaustion she
suffered from her battles with the waves,
she found exhilaration in the exciting discovery.</p>

<p>Dorothy threw off the blankets, sat up
and swung her legs over the edge of the
bunk. Her bathing suit was still wet and
clung uncomfortably to her skin. With
a hand on the side of the bunk to support
her, she stood up on the heaving floor to
catch sight of her face in a mirror screwed
to the opposite wall.</p>

<p>"Gracious! I'm a fright," she cried. "I
don't suppose there's a vanity case aboard
this lugger--and mine went down with
the poor little <i>Scud</i>!"</p>

<p>Then she spied a neat pile of clothing at
the foot of the bunk, and immediately investigated.
A dark blue sweater, a pair
of trousers, heavy woolen socks, and a pair
of boy's sneakers were seized upon and
donned forthwith.</p>

<p>Dorothy giggled as she surveyed herself
once more in the little mirror. "Just a few
sizes too large, that's all. But they're
warm, and <i>dry</i>, and that's something!"</p>

<p>She rummaged about on a shelf, found
a comb and with dexterous fingers
smoothed her short damp hair into place,
then with a sigh of satisfaction, muttered
again to herself, "Much better, my girl."</p>

<p>Her makeshift toilet completed, she decided
to leave the cabin and continue her
explorations outside.</p>

<p>There were two doors, one on the side
and one at the end which evidently led
forward. After a moment's hesitation,
Dorothy chose the latter. With some difficulty,
for the ship still pitched unmercifully,
she stumbled forward. Then, summoning
up her courage, for she was not
without trepidation at the thought of facing
her desperado rescuers, she laid a hand
on the knob and turning it, swung back
the door.</p>

<p>Dorothy found herself in a small,
glassed-in compartment, evidently the pilot
house. She had hardly time to glance
about, when an oddly familiar voice spoke
from out the darkness. It was barely
distinguishable above the motor's hum.</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Dixon, snap off the light
or shut the door. I can't possibly guide
this craft in such a glare."</p>

<p>"Why, it's Bill Bol--Mr. Bolton, I
mean," she cried in surprise, and closed
the door.</p>

<p>"Himself in the flesh," replied that
young man.</p>

<p>She could see him clearly now, seated
directly before her. His back was toward
her and he did not turn round. So far as
she could see he seemed very busily engaged,
doing something with his feet.</p>

<p>"Then--then it must have been you who
picked me up," she stammered.</p>

<p>"Guilty on the first count, Miss Dixon."</p>

<p>"Please don't be funny," she retorted,
now mistress of herself once more. "I
want to thank you--"</p>

<p>"You are very welcome. Seriously,
though, it is the boathook you have to
thank. Without that we'd both have gone
to Davy Jones' locker long before this."</p>

<p>Dorothy was nearly thrown off her feet
by an unusually high sea which crashed
over the pilot house and rolled the vessel
far over on her side.</p>

<p>"Whew--that was a near one!" the girl
exploded as the ship righted itself.</p>

<p>"We'll weather it, don't worry," encouraged
Bill, though he did not feel the confidence
his words proclaimed.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," said Dorothy soberly,
"as though we'll be mighty lucky if we
reach shore at all--and I guess you know
it."</p>

<p>"Never say die, Miss Dixon!"</p>

<p>"Suppose we drop this miss and mister
stuff, Bill. Sounds rather silly at a time
like this, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Right you are, Dorothy. I'm not
much on ceremony, myself, as the Irishman
said when--"</p>

<p>"Look here, Bill!" Dorothy tossed her
head impatiently, "I wish you'd omit the
comedy--it really isn't necessary. I'll admit
I was in a bad way when you dragged
me out of the briny deep--and I appreciate
your coming to my rescue. But you
needn't expect me to faint or to throw
hysterics. That sort of thing went out of
fashion long ago. Girls today have just
as much nerve as boys. They don't very
often get a chance to prove it, that's all."</p>

<p>"Please accept my humblest apology,
mademoiselle." Bill's eyes twinkled
though his tone was utterly serious. "I
can assure you--"</p>

<p>Dorothy's merry laugh rang out--her
mood had passed as suddenly as it had
come. "Don't be absurd. Tell me--why
are <i>you</i> piloting a rumrunner?"</p>

<p>"Rumrunner? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If this isn't a rumrunner, why do you
carry that machine gun and the rifles and
revolvers in the armsrack?"</p>

<p>"Just part of our equipment, that's all."</p>

<p>Dorothy's impatience flared up again.
"Why do you talk such nonsense?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. You don't mean to tell me
that you took a boat of this size on long
cruises!"</p>

<p>Bill grinned in the darkness. "But you
see," he chuckled, "this isn't a boat."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it then?"</p>

<p>"A Loening amphibian. Not exactly
the stock model, for Dad and I had quite a
few changes made in the cabin and this
pilot's cockpit."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" shrieked Dorothy. "An airplane--one
that can land either on water
or on land?"</p>

<p>"That's right. The old crate has the hull
of a boat equipped with retractible wheel
landing gear which operates electrically."</p>

<p>"You're too technical for me," she said
frowningly, and balanced herself with
a hand on the back of the pilot's seat. "But
if this is an airplane, why keep bouncing
along on the water? I'd think you'd fly
to land and have done with it."</p>

<p>"My dear girl--" began Bill.</p>

<p>"Don't use that patronizing tone--I'm
not your dear girl--not by a long shot!"</p>

<p>Bill laughed outright. "My error once
more. However, Miss Spitfire, when you
learn to fly, you'll find out that air currents
are very like water currents. When it is
blowing as hard as it is now, flying a plane
is fully as dangerous as sailing a boat--more
so, in fact. When the wind reaches
a certain velocity, it is impossible to balance
your plane. You have to land--or
crash."</p>

<p>Dorothy was beginning to understand.
"Then you must have taken some awful
risks coming out after me."</p>

<p>"I was lucky," he admitted. "But you
see, even if we were able to fly in this gale,
now, it's quite impossible to take off in
such a heavy sea. If I gave the old bus
enough gas to get up a flying speed, these
combers would batter the hull in--I'd
never be able to get her onto her step.
Some day, when it's fine, and the water's
smooth, I'll show you what I meant by
that. Now all we can do is to taxi."</p>

<p>"Taxi?--This is the first seagoing taxi
I've ever been in!"</p>

<p>"In air parlance," he explained, "to taxi
is to run a plane along the ground or on
the water--just now, it isn't all it's cracked
up to be."</p>

<p>"I should think it would be easier than
flying."</p>

<p>"Not on water as rough as this. Your
legs go to sleep with the strain you have
to put on the rudder pedals."</p>

<p>"Oh--you're steering with your feet?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you let me help you?
I'll drive her for a while," offered Dorothy.</p>

<p>Bill shook his head. "It's terribly hard
work," he demurred.</p>

<p>"What of it? I'm as strong as an ox."</p>

<p>"Thanks a lot. You're a real sport. But
the difficulty is in shifting places with me
without swamping the old bus. She isn't
equipped with dual controls. There's
only one set of pedals, and as soon as I release
them she will slue broadside to the
waves, the wings will crumple, and she'll
simply swamp and go under."</p>

<p>"And you must taxi either before the
wind, or into the wind as we are now, in
seas like these?"</p>

<p>"You've guessed it," he nodded.</p>

<p>"But there must be some way we can
manage it," argued Dorothy. "You can't
keep on much longer. Your legs will give
out and then we'll go under anyway."</p>

<p>Bill hesitated a moment. "Well, all
right, let's try it--but it's no cinch, as you'll
find out."</p>

<p>"That's O.K. with me. Come on--orders,
please--and let's go!"</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch03' class='c007'><i>Chapter III</i><br />Â <br />A WILD RIDE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"Hey, not so fast," laughed Bill. "First
of all, will you please step into the cabin,
and in the second locker on your right
you'll find a helmet and a phone-set. Bring
them out here. This shouting is making
us both hoarse and we'll soon be as deaf
as posts from the noise of the motor."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, skipper," breezed Dorothy,
and disappeared aft.</p>

<p>In a minute or two she returned with
the things he had asked for. Bill showed
her how to adjust the receivers of the phone
set over the ear flaps of her helmet. Then
reaching for the head set at the other end of
the connecting line, he put it on and spoke
into the mouthpiece which hung on his
chest.</p>

<p>"Much better, isn't it?" he asked in a
normal tone.</p>

<p>"It certainly is. I can hear you perfectly,"
she declared into her transmitter.
"--What next?"</p>

<p>"Come over here and sit on my lap.--I'm
not trying to get fresh," he added with
a grin, as she hesitated. "I've had to make
a shift like this before with Dad. There is
only one way to do it."</p>

<p>Dorothy was a sensible girl. She obeyed
his order and placed herself on his knees.</p>

<p>"Now put your feet over mine on the
rudder pedals. And remember--to turn
right, push down on the right pedal, and
vice versa. Get the idea?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thanks."</p>

<p>"Fine. Next--grab this stick and keep
it as I have it. Now, I'm going to pull my
feet from under yours--ready?"</p>

<p>"Let her go!"</p>

<p>Bill jerked his feet away, to leave
Dorothy's resting on the pedals.</p>

<p>"Good work!" he applauded. "The old
bus hardly swerved. Keep her as she's
pointed now. We can't change her course,
much less take off until we hit one of those
inlets along the Connecticut shore, and
smoother water. Brace yourself now--I'm
going to slide out of this seat."</p>

<p>Dorothy was lifted quickly. Then she
dropped back into the pilot's seat to find
herself fighting the tenacious pull of heavy
seas, straining her leg muscles to keep the
plane from floundering.</p>

<p>"How's it going?" Bill's voice came
from the floor of the cockpit where he was
busily engaged in pounding circulation
back into his numbed legs and feet.</p>

<p>"Great, thanks. But I will say that this
amphibian of yours steers more like a
loaded truck in a mudhole than an honest-to-goodness
plane! How are your legs?"</p>

<p>"Gradually getting better--pretty painful,
but then I'm used to this sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" she exclaimed sympathetically,
then gritted her teeth in the effort to
keep their course as a huge comber crashed
slightly abeam the nose.</p>

<p>Bill grasped the side of her seat for support.
"You handled that one nicely," he approved
when the wave had swept aft. "But
don't bother about me--you've got your
own troubles, young lady. I'll be all right
in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"What I can't understand," said
Dorothy, after a moment, "is why this
plane didn't sink when you landed and
picked me up. How <i>did</i> you keep from
slewing broadside and going under?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was like this. When I left you
on the beach, I motored back home to New
Canaan. The sky was blackening even
then. I was sure we were in for the storm,
so after putting up the car, I went out to
the hay barn in that ten acre field where
we house the old bus. She needed gas, so I
filled the tanks, gave her a good looking
over and went back to the house and telephoned."</p>

<p>"You mean you phoned the beach club
about me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The steward said you weren't
anywhere around the club, and your sloop
wasn't in the inlet. It was pretty dark by
then and the wind was blowing a good
thirty-five knots. I made up my mind you
must be in trouble. Frank ran after me on
my way out to the plane--he's our chauffeur
you know--"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know--" broke in Dorothy--"he
drove you and your father to the
movies last night. I saw him."</p>

<p>"That's right. Frank's a good scout.
He wanted to come along with me, but I
wouldn't let him."</p>

<p>"I s'pose you thought you'd save <i>his</i>
skin, at least?"</p>

<p>"Something like that. A fellow doesn't
mind taking responsibility for himself--it's
a different thing with some one else.
Well, before Frank and I ran this plane
out of the barn, I rigged the sea anchor
(nothing more than a large canvas bucket
with a couple of crossed two-by-twos over
the top to keep it open) with an extra long
mooring line. The sea-anchor I brought
up here in the cockpit with me. The other
end of the line was fastened to a ring-bolt
in the nose, of course. Well--to get
through with this yarn--I took off alone
and flew over to the Sound."</p>

<p>"But wasn't it awful in this wind?"</p>

<p>"It was pretty bad. As soon as I got
over water, I switched on the searchlight,
but it was a good half-hour before the light
picked you up. Then I landed--"</p>

<p>"Into the wind or with it?" interrupted
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Getting interested, eh?" commented
Bill with a smile. "Well, just remember
this then, never make a downwind landing
with a seaplane in a wind blowing over
eighteen miles an hour."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the wind behind your plane
will increase the landing speed to the
point where you will crash when you
strike the water--that's a good reason, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Then you landed into the wind when
you came down for me?"</p>

<p>"That's right. And as soon as I struck
the water, I shut off the motor, opened one
of these windows and threw over the sea
anchor. Then I fished you out with the
boathook."</p>

<p>"It sounds sort of easy when you tell
it--but I'll bet it wasn't." She gazed at
him admiringly. "You surely took some
awful chances--"</p>

<p>"Hey there!" called Bill. "Pull back the
stick or you'll nose over."</p>

<p>"That's better," he approved as she
obeyed his order. "Keep it well back of
neutral. Sorry I yelled at you," he
grinned.</p>

<p>Bill got to his feet. "I'm O.K. now,"
he went on, "and you must be pretty well
done up. I'm going to take it over."</p>

<p>Seating himself on her lap, as she had
sat on his, he placed his feet upon hers. A
minute later, she had drawn her feet back
from the rudder pedals, slipped out from
under and was seated on the floor, rubbing
life back into her feet and legs, as Bill had
done.</p>

<p>"Why is it," she inquired presently,
"that the plane rides so much smoother
when you're guiding her?"</p>

<p>Bill smiled. "When I give her right
pedal, that is, apply right rudder, I move
the stick slightly to the left and vice versa.
In that way I depress the aileron on the
side I want to sail. It aids the rudder.
You got along splendidly, though, and
stick work when taxiing needs practice."</p>

<p>Dorothy got to her feet, rather unsteadily.
"Look!" she cried. "Lights ahead.
We must be nearing shore, Bill."</p>

<p>"We are. There's a cove out yonder
I'm making for. And better still, the wind
is lessening. Just about blown itself out,
I guess."</p>

<p>In another ten minutes they sailed in
through the mouth of an almost landlocked
inlet and with the motor shut off drifted in
comparatively smooth water.</p>

<p>"Any idea where we are?" inquired
Dorothy, when Bill, after throwing out the
anchor, came back to her.</p>

<p>"Somewhere between Norwalk and
Bridgeport, I guess," he replied. "There
are any number of coves along here. I'll
take you ashore, now. We've got a collapsible
boat aboard. Not much of a craft,
but it'll take the two of us in all right.
We'll go over to one of those houses, and
get your father on the phone. He can
come down and drive you back to New
Canaan."</p>

<p>"Drive us both back, you mean!"</p>

<p>"Sorry--but it can't be done. I've got
to take this old bus home as soon as the
wind dies down a little more."</p>

<p>"How long do you suppose that will
be?" asked Dorothy quietly.</p>

<p>Bill glanced up at the black, overcast
sky and then turned his gaze overside and
studied the water toward the inlet's mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh, in about an hour I'll be able to take
off."</p>

<p>"Then I'll wait and fly back with you."</p>

<p>"You certainly are a sportsman," he
applauded and looked at his wrist watch.
"It's only ten to six--though anyone would
think it was midnight. I'll tell you what--suppose
I shove off in the dinghy. I'll row
ashore and telephone your Dad from the
nearest house. He will be half crazy if he
knows you were out sailing in that blow
and haven't reported back to the club. In
the meantime, you might scare up something
to eat. There's cocoa, condensed
milk, crackers and other stuff in the cabin
locker nearest the stove. You must be
starved--I know I am!"</p>

<p>They were standing on one of the narrow
decks that ran from amidships forward
to the nose of the plane below the
pilot house.</p>

<p>"The very thought of food makes me
ravenous," declared Dorothy, starting for
the cabin door. "Give Dad my love and
say I'm all right--thanks to you!" she
threw back over her shoulder--"Tell him
to put back dinner until seven-thirty--and
to have an extra place laid. In the meantime
I'll dish up a high tea to keep us
going."</p>

<p>Within the cabin, she set water on the
two-burner electric stove to boil. While
it was heating she let down the hinged table
and set it with oilcloth doilies, that she
found, together with other table necessities
in a cupboard next the food locker. She
discovered some bread and a number of
other eatables stowed away here, as well
as the things Bill had mentioned.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, Bill returned to
find the table set with cups of steaming
cocoa and hot toasted sandwiches spread
with marmalade.</p>

<p>"I'll say you're some cook, Dorothy!"
He pulled up a camp stool, and seated
himself at the table. "This is a real party!"</p>

<p>"There isn't any butter--" began
Dorothy doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Don't apologize. It's wonderful--do
start in or I'll forget my manners and
grab!"</p>

<p>Dorothy helped herself to a sandwich
and handed the plate across the table.
"Were you able to get Dad?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just caught him. He'd only got
home from the bank a few minutes before.
One of the maids told him you'd spoken of
going sailing, so he phoned the club about
you. He was just leaving the house to
drive down there when I rang him up."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything else?"</p>

<p>"Oh, naturally, he was glad you were
all right. He didn't seem so pleased when
I told him I was flying you back. He
asked me if I was an experienced pilot."</p>

<p>"He would." Dorothy chuckled.
"What did you tell him?"</p>

<p>Bill laughed as he helped himself to
another sandwich. "I wanted to get out
here to your high tea, you know, so I asked
him if he smoked cigarettes."</p>

<p>"<i>Cigarettes?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes. 'If you do, Mr. Dixon,' I said--you
know the old slogan, 'Ask Dad--he
knows--' and I'm sorry to say I rang off."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he goes over and asks your
father!"</p>

<p>"Very probably. Dad's rather touchy
when anybody questions my rating as a
pilot. I'm afraid your father will get an
earful."</p>

<p>Cocoa and toast had disappeared by
this time so the two in the cabin set about
clearing up.</p>

<p>"You must'nt mind Daddy's crusty manner,"
she said with her hands in a dishpan
of soapsuds. "He's always like that when
he's upset. He doesn't mean anything by
it."</p>

<p>Bill, who was stowing away cups and
saucers in the locker, turned about with
a grin. "Oh, that's all right. I had no business
to get facetious--my temper's not so
good, either. But there's no hard feeling."
He held out his hands. "If you're finished
with the dishpan I'll throw the water overside.
The storm has broken and there's
practically no wind. So if you're ready
we'll shove off for New Canaan--and I'll
give you your first hop."</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch04' class='c007'><i>Chapter IV</i><br />Â <br />THE FIRST HOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"How about giving me my first flying
lesson now?" Dorothy suggested as Bill
hauled in their anchor.</p>

<p>"You really want to learn?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do--I'm crazy about it!"</p>

<p>Bill coiled the mooring line, looping
it with practiced skill. "And I'd be glad
to give you instruction. But you're a
minor--before we can start anything like
that we must get your Dad's permission."</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll be all right, Bill," was the
young lady's cool assurance. "But how
about right now--"</p>

<p>"Every student aviator is a watchful
waiter the first time up. You stand behind
me this trip and I'll explain what I'm doing
as we go along."</p>

<p>"That'll be great! I'm just wild to fly
this plane!"</p>

<p>Bill smiled. "But you won't get
your flight instruction in this plane,
Dorothy."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"This amphibian is too big and heavy,
for one thing; for another, she isn't
equipped with dual controls."</p>

<p>"But what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"I see we'll have to start your training
right now, Miss Student Pilot--Controls
is a general term applied to the means
proved to enable the pilot to control the
speed, direction of flight, altitude and
power of an aircraft.--Savez?"</p>

<p>"You sound like a text book--but I get
you."</p>

<p>"All right. Now, unless we want the
bus washed up on the beach, we'd better
shove off."</p>

<p>Fastening the door to the deck after
them, they passed through the cabin and
into the pilot's cockpit where head-phone
sets were at once adjusted. The amphibian
bobbed and swayed at the push of little
waves. The sun's face, scrubbed clean
and bright by wind and rain was reflected
in the rippling water; whilst wet surfaces
of leaves, lawns, tree trunks and housetops
bordering the inlet gleamed in a wash of
gold.</p>

<p>Little gusts of fresh air blew in through
the open windows filling the cockpit with
a keen sweet odor of wet earth.</p>

<p>Dorothy drew a deep breath. "My! the
air smells good after that storm!"</p>

<p>"You bet--" agreed Bill. "But I'll smell
brimstone when your father comes into
the picture, if we don't shove off pronto
for New Canaan."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's just like a boy--" she pouted.</p>

<p>"Shush! student--Listen to your master's--I
mean,--your instructor's voice,
will you?"</p>

<p>"Instructor's better," she smiled.</p>

<p>"Here beginneth your first lesson." Bill
slid into the pilot's seat. "Stand just behind
me and hold on to the back of my
seat," he ordered.</p>

<p>Dorothy promptly did as she was told.
After all, was not this the real Bill Bolton
the famous ace and midshipman she had
read about?</p>

<p>"All set?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>"Good enough! Here we go then. I'll
explain every move I make, as I make it.
Look and listen! First--I crack the
throttle--in other words, before starting
the engine, set your throttle in its quadrant
slightly forward of the fully closed position.
Next, I 'contact'--that's air parlance
for 'ignition switch on.' After that,
I press the inertia starter to swing our propeller
into motion--" the engine sputtered,
then roared.</p>

<p>"It is most important," he went on a
moment later, "to see that the way ahead
and above is clear at this point. Safety
first is the slogan of good flying."</p>

<p>"Yes. But really, Bill, you don't have
to explain every thing you do. I'm watching
closely. When I don't understand, I'll
ask--if it's all the same to you?"</p>

<p>"Good girl. Don't hesitate to ask me,
though."</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>With that she saw him widen the throttle
and with his stick held well back of neutral
to prevent the nose dipping under the
waves, he sent the big seaplane hurtling
through the water toward the inlet's mouth.
The wind had changed since the storm and
now, as they raced into the teeth of the light
breeze, Dorothy tingled with that excitement
which comes to every novice with
the take off.</p>

<p>Six or eight seconds after opening the
throttle, she saw him push the stick all the
way forward.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that? Won't that raise
the tail of the plane and depress the
nose?"</p>

<p>Bill shook his head. "In the air--yes.
But we're moving at some speed now on
the surface--and the bow cannot be pushed
down into the water. Our speed is gradually
forcing it up until--now--we're skimming
along on the step, you see."</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded to herself and watched
him ease the stick back to neutral and
maintain it there while they gathered more
and more speed.</p>

<p>"Now I'm going to talk some more,"
said Bill. "Don't blame me if it sounds
like a text book.--In order to fly, certain
things must be learned--and remembered.
Do not take off until you have attained
speed adequate to give complete control
when in the air. Any attempt to pull it
off prematurely will result in a take off at
the stalling point, where control is uncertain.
Understand?"</p>

<p>"I think so--but how does one know
when to do it?"</p>

<p>"That comes with practice--and the
feel of the ship. As flying speed is gained,
I give a momentary pressure on the elevators
(like this)--and break the hull out
of the water--so--easing the pressure immediately
after the instant of take off.
Now that we are in the air our speed is
only slightly above minimum flying speed.
Any decrease in this would result in a stall.
That is why I keep the nose level for six
or seven seconds in order to attain a safe
margin above stalling point before beginning
to climb."</p>

<p>"There's certainly a lot more to it than
I ever dreamed!"</p>

<p>"You bet there is. I haven't told you the
half of it yet. One thing I forgot to say--you
must always hold a straight course
while taxiing before the take off. Also,
never allow a wing to drop while your
plane is on the step.--We've got enough
speed on now, so I'll pull back the stick
and let the plane climb for a bit."</p>

<p>"But you're heading for the Long Island
Shore directly away from New Canaan--"
she protested, "why don't you bring her
about--not that I'm in any hurry, but--"</p>

<p>"This is an airplane, not a sailboat,
Dorothy. All turns must be made with a
level nose. If I should try to turn while in
a climb like this, a stall would probably result,
and with the wing down the plane
would most likely go into a spin and--"</p>

<p>"We'd crash!"</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know!"</p>

<p>"<i>Oh!</i>"</p>

<p>"But the altimeter on the dash says one
thousand feet now. We're high enough
for our purpose. So I push the stick forward,
like this--until the nose is level--so!
Now, as I want to make a right turn, I
apply right aileron and simultaneously increase
right rudder considerably."</p>

<p>Dorothy saw one wing go up and the
other go down. She was hardly able to
keep her feet as the plane's nose swung
round toward the Connecticut shore.</p>

<p>"Isn't that called banking?"</p>

<p>"Right on the first count," replied Bill.</p>

<p>"Why do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Because in making a turn, the momentum
of the plane sets up a centrifugal
force, acting horizontally outward. To
counteract this, the force of lift must be
inclined until it has a horizontal component
equal to the centrifugal force. The
machine is therefore tilted to one side, or
banked, thus maintaining a state of equilibrium
in which it will turn steadily. No
turn can be made by the use of the rudder
alone. The plane must be banked with
ailerons before the rudder will have any
turning effect.--Get me?"</p>

<p>"I get the last part. Guess I'll have to
do some studying."</p>

<p>"Everybody has to do that. But I'll lend
you some books, so you can bone up on the
theory of flight. What I said just now
amounts to this: if you don't bank enough
you send your plane into a skid."</p>

<p>"Just like an automobile skids?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But of course the danger doesn't
lie in hitting anything as in a car. A skidding
plane loses her flying speed forward
and drops into a spin. On the other hand,
if you bank her too sharply, you go into
a sideslip!"</p>

<p>"And the result in both cases is a crash?"</p>

<p>"Generally. But I think you've had
enough instruction for today."</p>

<p>"Oh--but I want to know how you
ended that turn. We're flying straight
again now--and I was so interested in what
you were saying, I forgot to watch what
you did!"</p>

<p>"Well, after I had banked her sufficiently,
I checked the wings with the ailerons
and at the same time eased the
pressure on the rudder. Then I maintained
a constant bank and a constant pressure
on the rudder pedal throughout the
turn. To resume straight flight, I simply
applied left aileron and left rudder: and
when the wings were level again, I neutralized
the ailerons and applied a normal
amount of right rudder."</p>

<p>"My goodness!" exclaimed Dorothy--"and
that is only one of the things I have to
learn. I thought that flying a plane
wouldn't be much more complicated than
driving a car."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's simple enough--only you have
to balance a plane, as well as drive it."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'll ever learn?"</p>

<p>"Of course you will. It takes time and
practice--that's all."</p>

<p>"I wonder how birds learn to fly?"
Dorothy glanced down at the wide vista
of rolling country over which they were
traveling. The dark green of the wooded
hills, the lighter green of fields, criss-crossed
by winding roads and dotted with
houses, all in miniature, seemed like viewing
a toy world. And here and there, just
below them, there was the occasional flash
of feathered wings, as the birds darted in
and out among the treetops.</p>

<p>"Birds have to learn to fly, too. They
get into trouble sometimes."</p>

<p>"They do?"</p>

<p>"Certainly--watch gulls on a windy
day--you'll see them sideslip--go into
spins--and have a generally hard time of
it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, really? I'd never thought of
that. But of course they can fly much
better than a plane."</p>

<p>Bill shook his head. "That's where you
are wrong. No bird can loop, or fly upside
down. Reverse control flying and
acrobatics--stunting generally is impossible
for them.--But look below! Recognize
the scenery?"</p>

<p>"Why, we're almost over New Canaan.
There are the white spires of the Episcopal
and Congregational churches--and
there's Main Street--and the railroad station!"</p>

<p>"And over on that ridge is your house--and
mine across the way," he added.
"Well, here's where I nose her over. Hold
tight--we're going down."</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch05' class='c007'><i>Chapter V</i><br />Â <br />TROUBLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After releasing the rectractible wheel
landing gear, which turned the big amphibian
from a seaplane into one which
could land on terra firma, Bill brought his
big bus gently down to the ten acre lot
behind the Bolton residence.</p>

<p>As the plane rolled forward on its rubber
tired wheels and came to a stop, two
men came walking in its direction from
the trees at the edge of the field.</p>

<p>"Here come our respective fathers--"
announced Bill, stripping off his headgear.
"Remember--I take all responsibility
for bringing you back in the plane."</p>

<p>"You--do nothing of the kind!"
Dorothy's tone was final. She handed him
her head-phone and running back through
the cabin, vaulted the low bulwark to the
ground.</p>

<p>Bill hurriedly made things secure in the
cockpit and followed her.</p>

<p>"And so you see, Dad," he heard her
say, as he approached where they stood,
"Bill not only saved my life--he took all
kinds of chances with his own, flying in
a gale like that. And--oh! I forgot to
tell you that he warned me <i>not</i> to go out
in the <i>Scud</i> this afternoon!" she ended with
a mischievous look toward Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon was a tall man, whose tanned,
rugged features and searching gaze suggested
the sportsman. He turned from
his excited daughter, with a smile and an
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to realize, young man,
that I owe you an apology for my shortness
over the phone. Judging from Dorothy's
story, I can never hope to express my gratitude
for what you've done today."</p>

<p>Bill mumbled an embarrassed platitude
as he shook hands, and was glad when Mr.
Bolton broke into the conversation.</p>

<p>"The Boltons, father and son, were
probably born to be hung," he chuckled.
"It's a family trait, to fall into scrapes--and
so far, to get out of them just as
quickly. Now, as nobody has been polite
enough to introduce me to the heroine of
this meeting--I'm the hero's fond parent,
Miss Dorothy. We are about to celebrate
this festive occasion by a housewarming,
in the form of a scrap dinner at the hero's
home--what say you?"</p>

<p>"But I thought you were coming to our
house--" cried Dorothy. "I--"</p>

<p>"But me no buts, young lady. Your
father has already accepted for you both
and we simply can't take no for an answer."</p>

<p>Dorothy glanced at Bill, who stood
rather sheepishly in the background. Then
she laughed. "Why, of course, if you put
it that way--I'd love to come; that is, if
the <i>hero</i> is willing!"</p>

<p>"Say, do you think that's fair!" Bill's
face was red. He didn't think much of
that kind of kidding. "I think it would
be great, that is, if you mean me," he ended
in confusion.</p>

<p>Amid the general laughter that followed,
Dorothy uttered a cry of disgust.
"But I can't come like this--" she pointed
to her clothes, which were the things that
Bill had laid out for her in the big plane's
cabin.</p>

<p>"You look charming--" Mr. Bolton
bowed, and Dorothy blushed. "However--"</p>

<p>"Make it snappy, then, dear." Mr.
Dixon drew out his watch. "You have
just fifteen minutes. And Mr. Bolton
won't keep dinner waiting for you, if he's
as famished as I am!"</p>

<p>"Oh, give me twenty!" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"All right--hurry, now!"</p>

<p>With a wave of her hand, Dorothy
darted away.</p>

<p>"I'll look after the plane, Bill," said his
father, as she disappeared among the
orchard trees. "I want to show Mr. Dixon
over it, and that will give you time for a
slicking-up before dinner."</p>

<p>It was a jolly, though belated meal that
was eventually served to them in the cool,
green dining room of the Bolton's summer
home that evening. Mr. Dixon, with the
finesse of an astute business man, drew out
Mr. Bolton and his son, and the two told
tales of adventure by land and sea and air
that fascinated the New England high
school girl. It all seemed unreal to her,
sitting in the soft light of the candles. Yet
the Boltons made light of hairbreadth
escapes in the world's unmapped areas--just
as if these strange adventures were
daily occurrences in their lives, she
thought.</p>

<p>"It certainly is a shame!" she burst out
suddenly. Coffee had been served and
they had moved to the comfort of low
wicker chairs on the terrace. The air was
filled with the perfume of June roses.</p>

<p>"What's a shame?" Bill, now spick and
span in white flannels, settled back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"Why, all the wonderful times you and
Mr. Bolton have had--while Dad and I
were sticking around in New Canaan. I'd
love to be an adventurer," she finished.</p>

<p>"I dare say you'd find it mighty uncomfortable
at times," observed her father.
"How about it, Bolton?"</p>

<p>"Like everything else, it has its drawbacks
and becomes more or less of a grind
when one 'adventures' day in and day
out--" that gentleman admitted. "I'm
only too glad to be able to settle down in
this beautiful ridge country for a few
months--to rest and be quiet."</p>

<p>"There you are, Dorothy." Her father
smiled in the darkness. "And who would
there be out in the wilds to admire that
smart frock you're wearing, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Gee, Dad! You know I don't care
half as much about clothes as lots of the
girls--and that hasn't anything to do with
it, anyway."</p>

<p>"I think we ought to break the news to
her," suggested Bill, a white blur in the
depths of his chair.</p>

<p>Dorothy sat up eagerly. "What news?"</p>

<p>"But perhaps we'd better wait until tomorrow.
Tonight, she wants to become
an explorer--and give away all her best
dresses. She might not take kindly to it."
This from Mr. Dixon, between puffs of
aromatic cigar smoke.</p>

<p>"You're horrid--both of you. Don't
you think it's mean of them to make such
a mystery of whatever they're talking
about, Mr. Bolton? Won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I will, my dear. What do
you want to know?"</p>

<p>Dorothy choked with vexation. "<i>Oh!</i>"</p>

<p>"Let's tell her now--right now--" said
Bill, his voice brimming with laughter.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do--all together: one--two--three!
You--are--going--to--learn--to--fly!"</p>

<p>Dorothy sprang to her father's chair
and caught his arm. "Will you really let
me, Dad?" she cried in delight.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bolton says that Bill is an A-1 instructor--and
he claims that flying is no
more dangerous than sailing twenty-footers
in a nor'easter, so I suppose--"</p>

<p>"Oh--you <i>darling</i>!" Dorothy flung
her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"Here--here--" cried Mr. Dixon.
"You're ruining my collar, and my
cigar--"</p>

<p>"Have another," suggested Mr. Bolton.
"I'd willingly ruin boxes of cigars if I had
a daughter who'd hug me that way!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you nice!" She turned about
and bestowed a second affectionate embrace
on that gentleman. "That is because
you aren't quite as mean as your son--he's
the limit!"</p>

<p>"Never slang your instructor," sang
out Bill. "That's one of the first rules of
the air."</p>

<p>"Seriously, Dorothy," her father interposed.
"This is a big responsibility Bill
is taking--and I want your word that
you'll do just as he says. No more running
off and smashing up a plane as you did the
<i>Scud</i> this afternoon!"</p>

<p>"All right, Dad. I promise. But what
am I to learn in? Bill says that the Amphibian
is too heavy--and she's not
equipped with dual controls."</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon lit a fresh cigar. "I see that
you've already started your flight training."</p>

<p>"Bill explained the procedure to me on
our way up here this afternoon. But what
are we going to do for a plane?"</p>

<p>"Bill has some scheme, I believe."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," she decided. "Bill shall
pick me out a nice little plane and--"</p>

<p>"I shall pay for it," said her father
grimly. "Nothing doing. When you
have won your wings--well--we shall
see. Until then, you and Bill will have to
figure without financial help from your
fond parent."</p>

<p>"That's fair enough," agreed Mr. Bolton.</p>

<p>"O.K. with me, too," echoed Bill. "I
happen to have an old <i>N-9</i>, a Navy training
plane, down at the shipyard near the
beach club, that will do nicely. I was down
there this afternoon having her pontoon
removed. I want to equip her with landing
gear so I can house her up here. The
Amphibian uses up too much gas to go
joy-hopping in."</p>

<p>A maid appeared on the doorstep.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dixon wanted on the phone,
please," she announced, and waited while
that gentleman preceded her into the house.</p>

<p>A moment later Mr. Dixon was back on
the terrace.</p>

<p>"The bank's been robbed!" he cried.
"Sorry, gentlemen, but I've got to hustle
down there just as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"This way!" called Bill, springing down
the steps to the garden. "My car's out
here--come on!"</p>

<p>"That young chap can keep his head,"
thought Mr. Dixon as he ran beside his
daughter and Mr. Bolton. "It would take
a lot to fluster him."</p>

<p>Then they came upon him, backing
slowly up the drive, both doors swinging
wide so they could jump in the car without
his stopping.</p>

<p>"Which bank, Mr. Dixon?"</p>

<p>Bill had the car in the road now and was
racing toward the village.</p>

<p>"First National--Main Street, next the
Town Hall. I'm president, you know."</p>

<p>"I didn't know. But I'm glad to hear
it."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"You should have a drag with the traffic
cops. We are doing an even sixty now--and
it would be a bad time to get a ticket."</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon grasped the door-handle as
Bill skidded them into a cross road with
the expertness of a racing driver. "Just
get us there, that's all," he gasped. "The
chief himself phoned me. I didn't wait to
hear details--but from what I gathered,
the hold up men got clean away before the
police discovered the robbery. But time is
always a factor in a case of this kind, so
don't worry about traffic rules."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Bill and fed his powerful
engine still more gas.</p>

<p>Along the straight stretch of Oenoke
Avenue they sped, with Bill's foot still
pressing the accelerator. They flashed
past the white blur of the Episcopal
Church and on down the hill into Main
Street and the little town.</p>

<p>The car's brakes screamed and Bill
brought them to a stop on the edge of the
crowd of pedestrians and vehicles that
blocked further progress.</p>

<p>"D'you want us to wait here?" asked
Mr. Bolton.</p>

<p>"No--come along," returned his friend,
jumping to the sidewalk. "We'll learn the
worst together."</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch06' class='c007'><i>Chapter VI</i><br />Â <br />THE HOLD UP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With Bill at her right and Mr. Bolton
at her left elbow, Dorothy pushed her way
through the crowd behind her father to the
entrance of the Bank. The policeman at
the head of the short flight of steps to the
doorway stood aside at a word from Mr.
Dixon. The four passed inside and the
heavy door swung shut behind them.</p>

<p>"Rather like locking up the barn after
the sheep vamoosed, isn't it?" Bill nodded
over his shoulder toward the police guard.</p>

<p>"Never mind, son--this isn't our party,"
rebuked his father.</p>

<p>A fat man in a dark blue uniform, rather
tight as to fit and much be-braided, came
bustling up. "Who are these men, Mr.
Dixon?" he inquired pompously. "Can't
have strangers around the bank at this
time--"</p>

<p>"From what I hear, Chief, you and your
men let some strangers get away with
about everything but the bank itself a little
while ago." Mr. Dixon's tone showed his
annoyance. "These gentlemen are friends
of mine. What's actually happened?
Give me some facts. Anybody hurt?
Anybody caught? Just what has been
taken?" Questions popped like revolver
shots.</p>

<p>"Well--it's like this, sir--" The Chief
seemed pretty well taken down.</p>

<p>"Thunderation! You and your sleuths
are enough to tempt any man to law breaking.
There's Perkins! Perhaps I'll learn
something from him."</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon strode toward the rear of the
bank.</p>

<p>"You mustn't mind Dad," Dorothy said
consolingly. "Just now he's half crazy
with worry, Chief.--These gentlemen
are Mr. Bolton and his son. They've
bought the Hawthorne place, you know."</p>

<p>Chief Jones mopped his perspiring face
with a red bandanna and then shook hands
all around. "Terrible warm tonight--terrible
warm. Well, let's go over and find
out what's what. I was over to a party at
my daughter Annie's--only just got in
here myself. Annie--"</p>

<p>"Yes, let's find out what has happened."
Dorothy cut in on this long-winded effusion,
and led the way behind the tellers'
cages to where her father and several other
men were standing before the open
vault.</p>

<p>"Ah, here's the watchman now!" cried
Mr. Dixon as a man, his head completely
covered with bandages, came toward them
and sank weakly into a chair. "Now,
Thompson, do you think you can tell us
exactly what happened, before Doctor
Brown drives you home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Glad to." The man's voice,
though feeble, betrayed excitement. "He
sure knocked me out, that bird did--but
I'd know him again if I saw him. I c'd
pick him out of a million--"</p>

<p>"That's fine," Mr. Dixon interrupted
gently. "But start at the beginning,
Thompson, and we'll all get a better idea
of him."</p>

<p>"That I will, sir, and 'right <i>now</i>!' as
that French guy says over the radio....
Well, it was about eight o'clock and still
light, when the night bell buzzed. I was
expecting Mr. Perkins. He'd told me he'd
be back after supper as he had some work
to do. I'd been readin' the paper over there
by the window, so I got up and opened the
front door. But it wasn't Mr. Perkins. A
young fellow in a chauffeur's uniform
stood outside."</p>

<p>"'I'm Mr. Dixon's new chauffeur,' he
said. 'Here's a note from him. He tried
to ring you up, but the phone down here
seems to be out of order. He said you'd
give me a check book to take back to him.
Better read this.' He passed over a letter--"</p>

<p>"Have you still got it?" asked Mr.
Dixon.</p>

<p>"I think so. Yes, here it is, in my
pocket." Thompson handed the missive
to the bank president, who read it aloud:</p>

<p class='c008'>"'Dear Thompson:</p>

<p class='c008'>'Please give the bearer, my chauffeur,
a blank check book and oblige</p>

<div class='nf-right-c'>
<div class='nf-right c008'  >
    'Yours truly,<br />
    'John Dixon.'"
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Looks like my handwriting," sighed
Mr. Dixon when he had finished, "but of
course I didn't write it!--What happened
after that?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, he asked me if he could step
inside and take a few puffs of a cigarette,
seein' as how you didn't like him to smoke
on the job. So I let him in. Then I goes
over to one of the desks for a check book
and--I don't remember nothin' about what
happened next, until I found myself in the
far corner yonder, with Mr. Perkins near
chokin' me to death with some water he
was pourin' down my throat--and a couple
of cops undoin' the rope I'd been bound up
with. I reckon that feller must have
beaned me with the butt of his revolver just
as soon as I'd turned my back. Doc here,
says as how the skull ain't fractured--but
that bird sure laid me out cold. If I hadn't
had my cap on, he'd of croaked me sure.
Of course, I shouldn't of let that guy inside,
but--"</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon's tone was abrupt as he
silenced Thompson with a word. "Thank
you, Thompson," he said. "You are not
to blame. If you hadn't let him in, he
might have shot you at the door. Doctor
Brown is going to take you home now.
Lay up until you feel strong. And don't
worry."</p>

<p>He patted the man on the shoulder and
Thompson departed, leaning on the doctor's
arm.</p>

<p>"I guess you're next on the list, Harry."
Mr. Dixon nodded to Perkins. "How did
you happen in here tonight?"</p>

<p>The cashier, a slender young man, prematurely
bald, and dapper to the point of
foppishness, removed his cigarette from
his mouth and stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Had that Bridgeport transit matter and
some other work I wanted to finish," he
said crisply. "Told Thompson I would be
back about eight-thirty. Matter of fact, it
was twenty to nine when I rang the night
bell. I rang it several times, no answer;
then tried the door and found it unlocked.
I thought something must be wrong--and
was sure of it when I stepped in and saw
Thompson lying on the floor, his arms and
legs bound. Saw that he was breathing,
and went to the phone. It was dead--couldn't
raise Central. I didn't waste
much time then, but ran out and hailed
Sampson, the traffic cop on the corner.
Told him there'd been a holdup here, so
he blew his whistle, which brought another
policeman and we three raced back here."</p>

<p>"You brought Thompson to and cut his
bonds--then what?"</p>

<p>"I went to the vault. The door was ajar,
with books and papers scattered all over
the place. Haven't had a chance to check
up, but it looks as though everything in the
way of cash and negotiable securities has
been taken."</p>

<p>"But the door hasn't been damaged--they
couldn't have blown it open!"</p>

<p>The cashier shook his head. "No," he
admitted, "they opened it with the combination.
Must have used a stethoscope
or the Jimmy Valentine touch system--"</p>

<p>"Not with that safe, Perkins. But how
about the time lock?"</p>

<p>"It is never put on, sir, until we have no
more occasion to use the vault for the day.
I notified the Protective System people that
I would be working here tonight and
would set it when I was through."</p>

<p>"Humph!" growled the president in a
tone that boded ill for someone. "So the
time lock wasn't set!"</p>

<p>"It is the usual practice, sir," explained
Perkins nervously. "I--"</p>

<p>"Never mind that now. Anyone else
know anything about this robbery?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Sampson, the traffic policeman
saw the car."</p>

<p>"Well, let's hear from Sampson, then,
if he's here."</p>

<p>The officer came forward rather sheepishly.</p>

<p>"I was directin' traffic at the corner of
Main Street and East Avenue, sir, when I
seen your car run down Main and stop
in front of the bank here."</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> car!" exploded Dorothy's father.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir--least it was a this year's Packard
like you drive--and it had your license
number on it--AB521--I ought to know,
I see it every day."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the number--but--well ...
did you notice it further?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I did. That was about eight
o'clock. The chauffeur got out and rang
the bell at the entrance to the bank. Then
I seen him speak to Thompson and pass
inside."</p>

<p>"Did you investigate?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir. The man came out
almost directly and the door swung shut
behind him. Then he jumped into the car
and drove up the alley at the side of the
bank. You always park your car there,
sir, so I thought nothin' of it. About
twenty minutes later, out he drove again
and up Main Street the way he'd come.
And that's the last I've seen of him."</p>

<p>"There was only one man in the car--the
chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"I only saw one. If there was anybody
else, they must've been lying down, in the
bottom of the car."</p>

<p>"Very likely." Mr. Dixon turned to the
chief of police. "And what has been done
toward catching the thieves--or thief?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, as yet," the Chief confessed.
"But I'll get busy on the wire with descriptions
of the man and the car right away.
You see, I only just--"</p>

<p>"Never mind that--get along now and
burn up the wires. That car has had over
an hour's start on you. I'll look after
things here for the present."</p>

<p>The head of the local police force waddled
off with much the air of a fat puppy
who had just received a whipping, and Mr.
Dixon walked over to Mr. Bolton.</p>

<p>"You can do me a great favor, if you
will," he said.</p>

<p>"Name it, Dixon."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Go to the drug store down
the block and call up the Bankers Protective
Association in the city. You'll find
their number in the directory. Tell them
what's happened--that will be enough. I
want you to call their New York headquarters.
That will start them on the job
through their branches in short order."</p>

<p>"Right-oh!" his friend agreed. "And
when I get through with New York, I'll
see what New Canaan can do to fix your
phone here."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'll appreciate it."</p>

<p>"Anything I can do, Mr. Dixon?" inquired
Bill.</p>

<p>"Nothing here, thanks. But if you will
take my daughter home and see that she
doesn't get into any more trouble today, I'll
be much obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Dad</i>!" Dorothy, threw him a reproachful
look, then stood on tiptoe and
kissed her parent's cheek. "There, there.
I know you're worried. Phone me when
you want the car. I'll have sandwiches
and coffee waiting when you get home."</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon gave her an affectionate hug.
"You're a good little housewife," he
praised, "but run along now--both of you.
There are a million-odd things to be done
before I can leave."</p>

<p>He beckoned to the cashier and disappeared
with him into the vault.</p>

<p>"Not that way, Bill--" Dorothy's voice
arrested Bill as he started for the door.
"Come out the back way."</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. But I've found something
that the rest seem to have missed. It
may be important--come and see."</p>

<p>"You're on, Miss Sherlock," he said.
Catching her arm, he hurried with her
toward the rear of the bank.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch07' class='c007'><i>Chapter VII</i><br />Â <br />GROUND TRAILS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Bill unlatched the back door of the bank,
pushed it open and stood aside for Dorothy
to pass through.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute." She put out a restraining
hand. The full glare of the arc
light in the alley fell on the damp ground
at their feet. "Right over there are the
tire marks of the holdup car. It's lucky
it rained this afternoon. The prints are
perfect in this mud."</p>

<p>"Well, that's interesting, but--"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Of course they won't solve the
mystery. That's what you were going to
say, isn't it?" Dorothy's voice was mocking
as she looked up at Bill. "But here--see
these footprints? From this door to
the car?" Her tone was triumphant now.
"They ought to help just a little, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>But Bill seemed unmoved at her discovery.
"Probably hoofmarks of the
cops," he said rather disparagingly.</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed. "If those footprints
were made by policemen I'll eat them.
Where are your eyes, Bill? The cops in
this town wear regulation broad-toed
shoes. When I heard the traffic cop tell
Dad that he'd seen the robbers' car go up
the alley, I dashed out here to have a look
around. And as soon as I saw these prints
I knew they were not made by broad-toed
boots. Let's examine them closer."</p>

<p>Taking care to avoid stepping on the
well defined trail that led from the door
to the tire marks of the car, the two studied
the line of footprints.</p>

<p>"One fellow wore rubber soled shoes--I
guess you're right, Dorothy," acknowledged
Bill, squatting on his heels. "The
pattern on this set of prints could have
been made by nothing else. But what do
you make of these tracks here? Just holes
in the mud with a flat dab right ahead?"</p>

<p>"High heeled shoes, Bill. One of this
gang is a woman, that is clear enough.
What bothers me is the third set--look!"</p>

<p>Bill stared at the footprints to which she
pointed. "The right-hand one was made
by a long, narrow shoe, but I'll swear that
boot last was never made in America. It's
too pointed," he said finally. "The shoe
that made that imprint was bought in
southern Europe, I'll bet--Italy, probably.
But those queer looking marks to the left
are beyond me," he frowned. Then he
cried--"No, they're not! I have it--the
man who made those prints was club-footed!"</p>

<p>Dorothy disagreed with him. "A club-foot
couldn't make that mark. It is too
symmetrical--straight on both sides and
kind of rounded at the back and front. It
wasn't made by a wooden leg, either, Bill!"</p>

<p>"No. That would simply dig a hole in
the mud."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! Why didn't I see it at
once!" she exclaimed excitedly--"The
man was lame!"</p>

<p>Bill snorted. "And he had long pink
whiskers which he tied round his waist
with a green ribbon!"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly--I know what I'm talking
about."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> that a lame man made that set
of marks."</p>

<p>"Very well. May Doctor Watson inquire
on what Miss Sherlock Holmes
bases her astounding deduction?"</p>

<p>"On those queer marks, of course,
stupid!"</p>

<p>"Thanks. The clouds have vanished.
You make everything so lucid." Bill stood
erect once more.</p>

<p>"But, Bill--did you ever see a lame man--whose
left leg was shorter than his
right?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I did. But I can't swear at this
distant date which leg was the shorter."</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you that in this case,
the left was!"</p>

<p>"Maybe--"</p>

<p>"Maybe nothing! Why am I sure of
it? Because the man wore a lame man's
boot--the kind with a very thick sole. My
grandfather wore one. He twisted his hip
when he was a boy and that leg didn't grow
as long as the other. What is more, he always
walked on the <i>sole</i> of his big boot--the
heel never touched the ground!"</p>

<p>"I believe you <i>are</i> right," mused the
young man, studying one of the queer footprints
again.</p>

<p>"I know I am, Bill. That kind of a shoe
would make exactly that print. Not such
a bad hunch to take a look out here, was
it?"</p>

<p>"You're a swell sleuth, Dorothy. Let's
see. Now we know there were three in the
gang this evening. The chap who played
chauffeur and wore sneakers, a woman,
and a lame man--probably an Italian."</p>

<p>"Yes. But that doesn't solve the mystery,
does it?"</p>

<p>"No, but it helps a lot. How about the
tire tracks?"</p>

<p>"Not our car. Daddy uses Silvertowns
and those were made by some other kind."</p>

<p>"Goodyears, I should say. How about
going in now and telling your father what
we've learned?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not, if you don't mind?"</p>

<p>"Why!"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Bill, Dad hasn't much
confidence in girls' views on what he calls
'the practical side of life'--mine especially.
There'll soon be a bunch of detectives
on this case. If they find out for
themselves, it's O.K. with me--but I shan't
tell them."</p>

<p>"You want to work up the case yourself?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly it. If you'll help me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I will. But we may get into
trouble--I mean it is likely to be dangerous
work."</p>

<p>"Does that bother you?"</p>

<p>"I'd hate to have you get hurt--"</p>

<p>"I won't do anything on my own without
telling you first. We'll work together.
Does that suit your highness?"</p>

<p>"You bet! Where do we go from here?"</p>

<p>"Back to my house. We'll go down the
alley and hop in your car. I want to ride
up to our garage. I've got another
hunch."</p>

<p>"The kid's clever," remarked Bill admiringly.
"Want to tell me? I haven't a
glimmer."</p>

<p>They turned out of the alley into Main
Street before Dorothy answered.</p>

<p>"Suppose you guess," she suggested
teasingly as she stepped into the car. "Or,
better still, now that you've become my
aviation instructor, I'll even things up and
give you a short course in sleuthing."</p>

<p>"That's a go, teacher," grinned Bill.
The car rolled up the hill past the white
Memorial Cross on the village green.
"But to a mere amateur in crime it looks
as though you had barged into a pretty
good mystery, no kidding."</p>

<p>"Sh--" commanded Dorothy. "Sherlock
Holmes is thinking."</p>

<p>"Don't strain anything," Bill advised
as he stepped on the accelerator.</p>

<p>Dorothy did not retort to this thrust, but
remainder wrapped in her thoughts for
the remainder of the ride. Bill turned the
car into the Dixon's drive before she spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Keep on to the garage, please."</p>

<p>"Right-oh! Still sleuthing, I take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the big idea?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see."</p>

<p>He drew up under the arching elms
with the glare of their headlights focussed
upon the closed garage doors. Dorothy
sprang out and ran forward.</p>

<p>"Locked," she affirmed, giving the
handle a tug. "Wait a minute, Bill. I'll
be right back." She disappeared in the
direction of the house.</p>

<p>Bill shut off the engine and clambered
down to the ground. Presently he saw
her coming back, accompanied by a woman
in maid's cap and apron.</p>

<p>"All right, Lizzie," her young mistress
said, "I want to look at something first.
Then you can tell us exactly what happened.
That's right, give me the key."</p>

<p>She swung open one of the wide doors.</p>

<p>"The Packard's there, just as I told you,
Miss Dorothy," volunteered Lizzie as the
three stepped inside the garage. "It's
your car that's missing."</p>

<p>"I left it at the beach club--" Dorothy
cut herself short. "The license plates are
gone from the Packard!"</p>

<p>"Wasn't that to be expected after what
the cop told us in the bank?" There was
a hint of mockery in Bill's voice.</p>

<p>"Of course. But the point is--were
they taken this afternoon while Daddy had
the car parked behind the bank--or later
this evening after he drove home? He
would never remember whether he drove
from the bank with the plates still attached
or not. He never notices details like that."</p>

<p>Bill seemed amused. "Perhaps not--but
what's the difference?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. You'll soon get another
slant. Now, Lizzie--start from the
very beginning."</p>

<p>Lizzie spoke up eagerly. "Yes, miss.
Cook and me was havin' our supper in the
kitchen, miss--"</p>

<p>"Where was Arthur?--He's our
chauffeur-gardener," explained Dorothy
to Bill.</p>

<p>"It's Arthur's night off, miss. He went
to the movies--said he'd get a bite at the
lunch wagon in the village, though why
a man should want to eat hot dogs and such
trash with honest-to-goodness vittles waiting
for him at home is more than--"</p>

<p>"Never mind that now, Lizzie.--You
and cook were eating supper--?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss. We was just finishin' when
we heard a car pass the house on its way
out to the garage. I thought it might be
Arthur, back in the Ford for some supper.
Cook said--"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lizzie, please! What happened
then?"</p>

<p>"Why, a man came to the back door and
asked for the key to the garage. Said as
how he had orders to fix the Packard."</p>

<p>"What time was that?"</p>

<p>"About five minutes after we heard the
car drive out here, miss."</p>

<p>"No--I mean the time of day."</p>

<p>"I couldn't rightly say, Miss Dorothy.
The kitchen clock is down to Whipple's
being mended. But it was just after you'd
gone over to Mr. Bolton's for dinner."</p>

<p>"What did the man look like, Lizzie?"</p>

<p>"Like any young man, miss."</p>

<p>"But was he tall or short?"</p>

<p>"Kind of medium-like--"</p>

<p>"Dark hair or light?"</p>

<p>"I can't seem to remember--he had a
chauffeur's cap on and was in his shirt
sleeves, that I do know."</p>

<p>"Did you notice if he limped?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't, miss--but the other fellow
did--him with the big boot."</p>

<p>"Bull's eye!" cried Bill. "You're sure
some detective, Dorothy!"</p>

<p>"Keep still?" ordered that young lady.
And then to the housemaid: "We'll take
up the man with the big boot in a minute,
Lizzie. Now then, you gave the other one
the garage key, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>Lizzie snorted. "That I didn't, miss. I
took the key off the hook and walked out
to the garage with him. Mr. Dixon
wouldn't be thankin' me to let strange men
fool round in the garage by theirselves!"</p>

<p>"Then how in thunder did they cop the
license plates without your seeing them?"
exploded Bill.</p>

<p>"Do shut up and let me talk!" Dorothy
stamped her foot impatiently. "Now,
Lizzie, what happened next?"</p>

<p>"Well, miss, I unlocked the doors and
he started tinkerin' with the engine of the
Packard there. Then all of a sudden he
went out to the other car and spoke to
somebody inside."</p>

<p>"What car was that?"</p>

<p>"The one he'd drove up in. It was
parked out on the drive where the young
gentleman has his'n now."</p>

<p>"Another Packard, was it?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say, miss. I didn't pay much
attention to it, except that it was a closed
car--and there was a man and a woman
in back."</p>

<p>Dorothy exchanged glances with Bill.
"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then the young feller comes back and
says as how the lady in the car was feeling
sick, and could I fetch her a glass of water
with a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda
in it. I knew we had some in the medicine
chest upstairs, so--"</p>

<p>"So you went back to the house and got
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>"And <i>that's</i> when they copped the
plates!" declared Bill, the irrepressible.</p>

<p>"Bull's eye!" derided Dorothy. "How'd
you guess it?"</p>

<p>"Form of genius some of us have."</p>

<p>Dorothy ignored this last and turned
again to the maid. "What happened when
you brought back the bicarb, Lizzie?"</p>

<p>"I give it to the young lady in the car,
miss."</p>

<p>"Young, was she?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't get a good look at her face,
for she was dabbin' her eyes with a handkerchief
like she'd been cryin'. But she
was dressed in some of those new-fangled
pajamas like you wear to the beach, they
was--sort of yellow-green color--and a
wisp of her hair that had got loose from the
bandanna she wore was red--the brightest
red hair I ever see. She turned her
head away when she drunk the medicine,
but she thanked me prettily enough when
she handed back the glass."</p>

<p>"Have you washed it yet?"</p>

<p>"No, miss. You see, I--"</p>

<p>"Then don't. I want that glass, just as it
is. Was the lame man sitting beside her?"</p>

<p>"No. When I brought her the soda he
was comin' out of the garage with the
other fellow. He was carryin' a package
wrapped in newspaper and he says as
how he was takin' some part of the engine
back to the shop. He spoke kind of funny,
like a foreigner, I thought. And all dolled
up in a light suit and a cane. Why, he'd
even got lemon colored gloves on for all
his lameness and the big boot he wore!"</p>

<p>"Did the girl and the other man wear
gloves?"</p>

<p>"The man put them on when he started
to tinker with the car, I remember. But
the girl had no gloves on."</p>

<p>"You're sure?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, miss, because I noticed her
shiny pink finger nails, particular. I
thought at the time that washin' dishes
couldn't be no part of her life."</p>

<p>"That's fine, Lizzie. You make a
splendid witness."</p>

<p>"Thanks, miss. I got a good look at the
lame man, too. He had a funny little
black mustache like they wear in the
movies and little gold knobs in his ears--what
do think of <i>that</i>!" Lizzie paused
dramatically as she gave this choice bit of
information.</p>

<p>"Earrings?"</p>

<p>"Earrings, miss--and--"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lizzie. You may go
now."</p>

<p>"Remember those earrings, miss. And
I'll keep the glass for you, and won't let
cook touch it either, never fear!" Lizzie's
slight figure faded into the darkness.</p>

<p>"So you've got pretty good descriptions
of the gang <i>and</i> the lady's fingerprints!"
Bill summed up. "I've got to hand it to
you, kid. Reckon you'll have to let your
father know about it though. Those
fingerprints will have to be examined by
the police."</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded. "Guess you're right.
I'll tell him what we found out."</p>

<p>"What <i>you've</i> found out, you mean. As
I think I told you before, when it comes to
detective work, I'm a ground hog!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! But that reminds me, Bill.
Do I get a lesson tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Do you think you can take time enough
from your life work?"</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous. You may think
I've finished fooling with this robbery
when I turn over the dope to Daddy--but
I haven't. I want a flying lesson, just the
same, in the morning. Shall we go up in
the <i>Loening</i> again?"</p>

<p>"No. I'll drive you down to the shore
and we'll take the <i>N-9</i> out. Don't wait for
your father to-night. Tell him what you
want to at breakfast."</p>

<p>"But I've got to--"</p>

<p>"This is your flight instructor speaking,
Dorothy. No lesson in the morning for
you, young lady, unless you go straight
to bed now and get a good night's rest.
A clear head and steady nerves are the first
requisites for flying."</p>

<p>"All right then. I'll turn in directly.
Good night."</p>

<p>Bill was already seated behind the wheel
of his car. "Good night, Dorothy. By
the way, <i>I've</i> got a hunch about this bank
business. After you've had some flight
training we'll investigate together--and
the plane will be a great asset," he added
mysteriously. His foot pressed the self-starter.</p>

<p>"Don't be so vague--spill the news like
a good fellow."</p>

<p>"Sh--" mocked Bill. "'Sherlock
Holmes is thinking!'" His laugh rang
out and the car disappeared in the deep
shadows of the drive.</p>

<p>"He's not so dumb as he pretends,"
mused Miss Dixon. "What can he have
up his sleeve?"</p>

<p>Slowly she moved off toward the back
door of the house.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch08' class='c007'><i>Chapter VIII</i><br />Â <br />NEXT MORNING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"You've done splendidly, my dear. I'm
proud of you. This information you've
dug up will be a lot of help in tracing that
gang, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Dorothy and her father were seated at
the table, taking their morning meal in the
breakfast porch, just off the dining room.
Although the bond of affection uniting
father and daughter was a strong one,
especially since the mother's death some
years earlier, neither was particularly
demonstrative. And Dorothy was not
used to receiving unstinted praise of this
sort from her father. The colour in her
cheeks deepened, and she said off-handedly:</p>

<p>"I'm awfully glad, Daddy. You haven't
had your second cup of coffee, have you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon smiled, and passed his cup
to her. His shrewd glance took in her
evident embarrassment.</p>

<p>"No need to dissemble, daughter. Fact
is, I keep forgetting you're no longer a
child; and I don't mind telling you how
valuable you are to me."</p>

<p>Dorothy smiled back at him. "Thanks
a lot, Dad." She returned his filled cup.
"Did the gang get away with much?"</p>

<p>"Plenty. A number of easily negotiable
bonds, what currency we had on hand, etc.
Of course, we're well covered by insurance--but
the worst of it is, they took Mrs.
Hamberfield's diamond necklace!"</p>

<p>"What! The Hamberfields, of Canoe
Hill?"</p>

<p>"The same. They bought the old
Adams place two years ago and keep it
for a summer residence. More money
there than--er--taste, I believe. Mrs. H.
goes in for jewels on a big scale."</p>

<p>"Wears diamonds at breakfast, I'll bet,
Daddy. She came to the Country Club
last Saturday night, dressed up to the hilt
and beyond it. I've never seen so much
jewelry! Doug Parsons suggested that
she'd been robbing Tiffany's. A regular
ice-wagon with her diamonds!"</p>

<p>"Well, she's lost a lot of them, now.
That gang evidently knew she had a habit
of keeping some of them in her deposit box
at the bank, for it was the only one they
raided."</p>

<p>"That's interesting."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Never mind now. Tell me some
more."</p>

<p>"Well, naturally, I phoned the lady last
night--and well--she was most unpleasant--"</p>

<p>"The nasty cat! Serves her right to have
them stolen!"</p>

<p>"Hardly that, dear. But the bank is
responsible for her necklace and other
gewgaws. And her husband is a power in
the financial world."</p>

<p>Having breakfasted sufficiently for one
day, Dorothy was busy with an orange lipstick.</p>

<p>"More unpleasantness for you,
Daddy?" she asked through pursed lips,
her eyes on the small mirror of her compact,
open on the table before her.</p>

<p>"He is in a position to do the bank considerable
harm--By the way, Dorothy,
are you as efficient at manicuring as you
are at making up your mouth?"</p>

<p>"P-perhaps. Why?"</p>

<p>"Good. Then, after this I'll get you to
do my nails while I have my second cup
of coffee each morning!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you horrid!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you the cheeky kid, using that
thing in front of me?"</p>

<p>"You really don't mind, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Do you think it an improvement over
nature?"</p>

<p>"I know it isn't."</p>

<p>"Why use a lipstick then?"</p>

<p>"But--why do you wear that curly mustache?"</p>

<p>"More cheek?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. But it adds dignity to your
face--what's more, your mustache is becoming
and you know it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Mr. Dixon's tone was
derisive but there was a twinkle in his keen
gray eyes.</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded decisively. "While
my lipstick, properly used, is also becoming,"
she went on. "And it gives your
daughter a sophisticated appearance otherwise
lacking--" she broke off with a giggle
as she saw her father's expression.</p>

<p>Dorothy snapped her compact shut and
rose from the table. Going round to his
side, she gave her father a hug and kissed
him lightly on his mustache. "There!"
she laughed. "Now I've added sophistication
to your dignity, Daddy. You'll be
able to run both the bank and that ritzy
Mrs. Hamberfield like a charm today. So
long! Bill is coming for me and we're going
down to the beach. I'm to have my first
real flight instruction this morning, you
know."</p>

<p>"From all accounts you did pretty well
yesterday, young lady. Don't you think
you'd better come down to the bank and
tell the story of your sleuthing to the
Bankers' Association detectives? They'll
be up here from New York this morning."</p>

<p>From the doorway, Dorothy shook her
head. "Nothing doing!" she cried. "I
love you a lot--but you have the story
down pat yourself--and I've got a date I
can't break. That glass with the fingerprints
on it, you'll find nicely wrapped up
on the hall table. 'By--" She was through
the door and across the lawn before Mr.
Dixon could reply.</p>

<p>He folded his napkin and laid it on the
table with a sigh. "Heigho!" he murmured.
"I wonder what her mother would
say to that? Still, Dorothy grows more
like her every day. The youngster has
brains if she only uses them in the right
way. She certainly has been a help on this
robbery--and she is a comfort to me--but
a great responsibility at that."</p>

<p>Then, carefully lighting his after-breakfast
cigar, Mr. Dixon walked into
the house.</p>

<p>Shortly after Mr. Dixon had left for the
bank, Bill's horn honked in the drive.</p>

<p>Dorothy appeared presently, wearing a
boy's outing shirt open at the neck and a
pair of fawn-colored jodhpurs. She noticed
as she approached the car that Frank,
the Bolton's chauffeur, was seated in the
rumble.</p>

<p>"I've got to run into New York and buy
some flying clothes," she announced as she
seated herself at Bill's side.</p>

<p>"Don't bother about clothes, for
heaven's sake. They won't help you to
fly. I've got several extra helmets and
some goggles and those things you're
wearing now will be just the thing. All
you need are overalls--and I bought you
those in the village this morning."</p>

<p>"Aren't you nice," she beamed. "But I
do need a leather coat, don't I?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell me the cockpits of your
N-9 were open--that they didn't have
windshields?"</p>

<p>"Yes--but what of it?"</p>

<p>"Won't it be cold?"</p>

<p>"Not at this time of year. We're not out
for an altitude record. Of course, when
you get a couple of miles or so above the
earth you have to bundle up--but the old
OXX motor in my N-9 would never get
you there. She's not built for that kind of
work. Later on, you can order a monkey
suit or a leather coat from the city."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll get one of those sporty knee-length
coats--" decided Dorothy gleefully.</p>

<p>"Not if I know it!"</p>

<p>"But why not? They're so goodlooking!"</p>

<p>"And more dangerous than a broken
strut!"</p>

<p>"They are?" Dorothy's tone was horrified.</p>

<p>"Certainly. If you buy a coat, get a
waist-length model. Anything longer not
only hampers a pilot, it catches the wind
and is likely to get caught around your
stick or other controls and crash the
plane."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Dorothy disappointedly.</p>

<p>Bill slanted his eyes from the road and
smiled at her. "Not everyone who wears
a yachting cap is a yachtsman! You'll
have plenty to think of during your flight
training without bothering about such
things."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," she agreed.
"How long will it take to teach me to fly,
Bill?"</p>

<p>"It all depends upon your aptitude,
Dorothy. Ask me again after ten hours
of dual instruction. But no matter how
apt you prove to be, flying is not learned
in a day. I've mapped out a forty-hour
course for you. Want to look it over?"
He handed her a typewritten sheet.</p>

<p>She studied the paper interestedly. It
was titled.</p>

<p>"Looks pretty complicated to me,"
sighed Dorothy, handing back the paper.
"Gee, but there's a lot to learn!"</p>

<p>"More than the average novice has any
idea of. But don't imagine that this course
will make you or anyone else an experienced
pilot. Additional time must be
spent in the air before you can get an interstate
commercial pilot's license. But
after the instruction I've outlined here,
your knowledge of flying should be sufficient
to enable you to go on with your
training yourself."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Dorothy, but there was
little confidence in her tone.</p>

<p>Bill brought the car to a stop beside an
open field.</p>

<p>"Cheer up!" he encouraged. "Flying
is like anything else worth while--troublesome
to learn, but easy enough when
you know how. Hop out, kid. There's
the N-9, with her new landing gear, over
there. Frank will take the car back.
We'll fly up to my place now and I'll give
you your first real instruction over our own
flying field!"</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch09' class='c007'><i>Chapter IX</i><br />Â <br />AIR TRAILS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Dorothy donned her overalls while Bill
spoke to the mechanic who was waiting by
the plane. Then the man got into a car
and drove away, and Bill beckoned her to
him.</p>

<p>"All set?"</p>

<p>"All set."</p>

<p>"Then we'll begin. First of all, you
must know the names of the different parts
of the plane. Some you know already, but
we'll go over them just the same. That
hinged movable auxiliary surface on the
trailing edge of the wing is an aileron. Its
primary function is to impress a rolling
movement on the airplane. Got that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then repeat what I just said."</p>

<p>Dorothy did so.</p>

<p>"Good. Now this is a drag wire."</p>

<p>After twenty minutes of this kind of
thing he asked her to point out an aileron
and explain its use.</p>

<p>"K.O." he said at last. "We'll go over
parts each day for a while and the book
work you must do at home will help to
refresh your memory. Now nip into the
forward cockpit and I'll explain the working
of the controls."</p>

<p>He gave Dorothy a hand up and when
she was seated, swung himself on to the
cowl of the cockpit.</p>

<p>"First of all--and let this become
habit--" he ordered, "adjust your safety
belt. Yes, that's the way. Now we'll go
ahead. That's the stick there. Take hold
of it. You'll notice it is pivoted at its base.
Forward movement of the stick increases
the angle of attack of the elevators and depresses
the nose. Backward movement decreases
angle and raises the nose. Lateral
movement of the stick operates the ailerons,
movement to the right depressing the
right wing, and to the left, the left wing."</p>

<p>When she was sure she understood the
functions of one thing he explained the
next.</p>

<p>"Now tell me just what I have told
you--" he commanded.</p>

<p>Fully an hour had gone by before he
was satisfied that she understood thoroughly.</p>

<p>"Tired?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," she smiled. "I'm afraid I'm
kind of dumb--but all these gadgets, as
you call them, are a little confusing at
first."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're catching on in first rate
order," he told her. "Nothing but practice
will make you letter perfect. And that
comes soon enough when you handle the
plane yourself. Now I'll fly us home. All
I want you to do is to fold your arms and
listen. Keep your eyes in the cockpit and
watch the movements of the stick and rudder
bar. My cockpit aft is equipped with
similar controls. When I move my stick--yours
moves--and vice versa. All right?"</p>

<p>"You bet."</p>

<p>He reached in his pocket and drew forth
a small leather-bound book which he
handed her.</p>

<p>"Here's your Flight Log Book,
Dorothy. Write it up after every flight.
There are columns for the date, type of
plane, duration and character of flight,
passengers or crew carried (if any) and
remarks. A commercial pilot should have
his log book certified monthly by an official
of the company. For a student it is a
good thing to commence during training.
Stick it in your pocket," he advised as she
thanked him. "And put on this helmet.
It's a Gosport, with phones in both ear
flaps, connected by a voice tube to this
mouthpiece. I'll use that end of it to
coach you through during flight."</p>

<p>"But this helmet is hard and stiff," objected
Dorothy. "I'll bet it isn't nearly as
comfortable as that nice soft leather one
you're wearing."</p>

<p>"Possibly not. But until you're through
with your instruction I want you to wear
a 'crash' helmet. They're a lot of protection
for the head in case of minor accident.
No instructor worth his salt permits a student
to use a soft leather helmet until
you've had a lot of experience."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well then," she said, adjusting
her heavy headgear, "you're the boss!"</p>

<p>"You bet I am when it comes to this kind
of thing. If I weren't sure you were willing
to give me strict obedience, I'd never
propose teaching you. And please remember
that this isn't a joy hop. The
more attentive you are to instruction--the
quicker you'll learn."</p>

<p>"I'm your willing slave, sir," she
mocked good-humoredly, and drew the
helmet strap tight beneath her chin.</p>

<p>Then as the engine roared and the plane
rolled forward she felt the same thrill she
had experienced the afternoon before
when she and Bill had taken off in the amphibian.
The same tightening of her
muscles and beating throb of the pulse in
her neck. They were soaring upward now
and the sensation of smoothness became
apparent after the jars and bumps of taxiing
over the rough field. The sting of the
wind on her face was exhilarating, but her
eyes were streaming. Realizing that she
had forgot to adjust her goggles, she pulled
them down from the front of her helmet.</p>

<p>"I've been wondering how long it would
be before you did that," came Bill's voice
through the headphones. "Never mind--it's
a grand thrill while it lasts--you'll lose
it soon enough."</p>

<p>Dorothy, for the first time in her life,
found a retort impossible to make.</p>

<p>"Now that we've got enough air under
us," Bill's voice continued, "I'm going to
fly straight for home. Remember what I
said about watching your stick and rudder
bar. Also keep an eye on the bank-and-turn
indicator as well as the fore and aft
level indicator and inclinometer."</p>

<p>Dorothy shifted her gaze to the instrument
board before her. Unconsciously
she ticked off the other instruments. There
were the two Bill had just mentioned; a
magneto switch, oil pressure gauge, earth
inductor, compass indicator, altimeter, 8-day
clock, primary pump and tachometer.
It pleased her that she could so readily recall
their names and uses. Then she
heard Bill's voice in her ear again:</p>

<p>"The reason that I keep pulling the stick
back slightly so often, Dorothy, in level
flight, is because the old bus is a bit nose
heavy. You'll notice it when you handle
her later on. It's nothing to worry about.
Very few planes are perfectly balanced."</p>

<p>Dorothy turned her eyes guiltily on the
stick again. She had been caught napping
that time! One really needed half a
dozen pairs of eyes for a job like this.
And--how different Bill's manner aboard
an airplane, she thought. He was certainly
all business. But she respected and admired
his knowledge and his ability as an
airpilot which left no opening for argument.</p>

<p>"You can look overside now," came his
voice again interrupting her thoughts.
"We're going to land."</p>

<p>Below them she saw the Bolton's house.
The nose of the plane dropped suddenly
as the stick went forward and they shot
down to land on the field near the Bolton's
hangar.</p>

<p>Bill spoke again from the rear cockpit.
"If you're ready for more flight instruction,
hold up your right hand."</p>

<p>Dorothy held up her right hand.</p>

<p>"Good. Then we'll practice taxiing,"
came back the even voice. "Remember
that a land plane with engine idling will
remain at rest on the ground in winds of
normal force. That means that all movement
of the plane must be made by use of
the engine. When your bus begins to
move you control it primarily by using the
rudder. In a wind as strong as the one
blowing now, you'll notice the plane's
tendency to turn into it. That's due to the
effect on the tail. It tends to swing like a
weathervane until the nose is headed
directly toward the point of the compass
from which the wind is blowing. Your
experience in sailing is going to be a great
help.</p>

<p>"Now, just one thing more and we'll
shove off. While taxiing, you must hold
the stick well back of neutral. That will
prevent any tendency of the tail to rise and
cause the plane to nose over. Grasp the
stick lightly with your fingers. Never
freeze onto anything. If you feel me
wiggle the stick sharply--let go at once.
I may or may not have my hands and feet
on the controls, but you cannot know that.
Act just as if you were alone in the plane.
Got all that?"</p>

<p>Dorothy raised her hand again.</p>

<p>"Then snap on the ignition and get going."</p>

<p>For the next hour she taxied the <i>N-9</i>
around the field while Bill issued commands
from the rear cockpit. So interested
was she in her lesson that it seemed no
time at all before he told her to shut off the
engine.</p>

<p>"Take off your helmet and get down,"
he said as the plane came to a stop. And
he helped her overside.</p>

<p>"Gee, Bill, it's wonderful!" she cried,
jumping lightly to the ground beside him.</p>

<p>"You did splendidly," he encouraged.
"This field is pretty rough in spots--makes
it bumpy going. How are you--stiff?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit!"</p>

<p>"You need a rest, just the same."</p>

<p>"But I'm not in the least tired. Can't I
go up now?"</p>

<p>Bill looked at her and shook his head.
"Nothing doing," he said with pretended
sternness. "That is--not for the next fifteen
minutes. Here comes Frank with
something cold to drink on his tray--horse's
neck, probably. There's nothing
like iced ginger ale with a string of lemon
peel in it when you're real thirsty!"</p>

<p>"My, you're thoughtful!"</p>

<p>"Don't thank me--it's all Frank's idea."</p>

<p>They sipped their drinks in the shade of
the old barn that had been turned into a
hangar for the Bolton's planes.</p>

<p>"While you're resting, I want you to
study this paper, Dorothy. It's a routine
I want you to follow in preparing for every
flight you take--with me, or soloing," he
explained, handing it over. "When you've
got it by heart, repeat it to me and then
we'll carry on. Your first job for the next
hop will be to do exactly what I've written
there."</p>

<p>For perhaps ten minutes both were
silent and Bill closed his eyes and turned
over on his back.</p>

<p>"Asleep?" asked Dorothy presently.</p>

<p>"No--just relaxing. Got that dope
down pat?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I mean, yes, instructor."</p>

<p>"Give me back the paper then, and
shoot!" he said, sitting up.</p>

<p>"Preparations for flight:" recited
Dorothy. "First, inspect the plane and
engine as necessary. Second, observe the
wind direction. Third, observe the course
direction (if a course is being flown).
Fourth, set the altimeter. Fifth, see that
helmet, goggles and cushions are properly
adjusted. Sixth, see that cloth to wipe
goggles is handy. Seventh, give the engine
a ground test. Eighth, see that the gas
valve is properly set. Ninth and last--Buckle
the safety belt!"</p>

<p>"One hundred per cent! Good work,
Dot. Now come over to the plane and
show me how you do it."</p>

<p>He grinned, awaiting a quick retort--but
Dorothy, intent on the business of
learning to fly, walked at his side in a fit
of concentration.</p>

<p>"She sure is keen," he said to himself.
"I never got a rise--and 'Dot,' to
Dorothy, is like waving the American
flag at a Mexican bull!"</p>

<p>Dorothy continued to prove her aptitude
for she went through the flight preparations
with but one mistake. She
entirely forgot the matter of the cloth to
wipe her goggles!</p>

<p>Presently he took her up again and
started in with his coaching.</p>

<p>"You now have thirty-five hundred feet
registered on your altimeter," he
announced through her phone. "Enough
air below to get us out of trouble if we
should happen to get into it. The higher
one flies, the safer one is. Now you are
going to get straight flight instruction.
I am moving the stick backward--now
forward--now backward--now forward.
See how the nose of the plane rises and falls
in response? Watch closely--I'm going
to do it again. There, now--take the stick
and do it yourself."</p>

<p>Dorothy did as he bade her. It was
thrilling to feel the huge plane respond to
her will.</p>

<p>Then followed instruction in moving
the stick successively right and left by
which means the right wing and then the
left are correspondingly depressed. After
that came rudder instruction. First Bill
pushed the right and left sides of the rudder
bar successively, forward, thereby
swerving the nose first to the right and
then to the left.</p>

<p>Dorothy, of course repeated these movements
after him.</p>

<p>Then he explained that to hold a steady
course, to fly straight, constant right
rudder must be maintained to overcome
the torque, or drag of the propeller blades
tending to swing the nose to the left.
While to fly level longitudinally, some
point on the engine is kept in line with the
horizon. That to fly level laterally, up
aileron and opposite rudder are applied
whenever a wing drops. He told her
numerous other things, such as that when
flying straight, the nose should frequently
be dropped momentarily, or the course
changed a few degrees in order to look
ahead. Otherwise, an approaching plane
may be hidden by the engine.</p>

<p>"Good night!" thought Dorothy as she
strained her ears to catch every word,
while she watched the controls and saw
how the plane reacted to their manipulation
by her instructor. "If it takes all this
detail to fly straight and level, I'll get the
heebie-jeebies when it comes to acrobatics!"</p>

<p>"Take over controls," came Bill's voice.
"Fly straight for that white church tower
on the horizon."</p>

<p>Dorothy's body stiffened, but she took
hold of the stick again bravely enough, and
placed her feet on the rudder bar at the
same time. She could feel her temples
throbbing, and her heart was beating faster
than the clock on her instrument board.
At last she was actually flying an airplane--all
by herself. But was she? Suddenly
there came a check in the forward
speed of the plane and Dorothy felt it start
to slew off sideways as the nose dropped.</p>

<p>Then before she knew exactly what was
happening, the stick in her hand seemed
to spring back, then to the right, while
right rudder increased considerably without
help from her foot. Up came the nose,
followed by the left wing, and down went
the right. The slewing stopped as suddenly
as it had begun. Then she felt left
aileron and left rudder being applied--and
once more the N-9 was flying straight
and level.</p>

<p>"Forgot what I said about checking a
skid just now, didn't you?" said Bill's voice
in her ear. "Here's the news again. Any
swinging of the nose to the left can be
promptly recognized and checked--but,--and
here's where you went wrong--the
nose cannot be swung back to the right
without applying a small bank. Any attempt
to do so will cause your plane to
skid. That naturally results in a loss of
flying speed forward and the heavier end
drops. If not checked at once, it means going
into a spin. Carry on again now, and
please try to keep your wits about you. This
is not a kiddie-car. Mistakes are apt to be
costly!"</p>

<p>Dorothy bit her lips in anger. More than
ever did she regret the lack of a mouth
piece on her head phone. Her temper
flared at his sharp tone, and what seemed to
her unfair criticism so early in the game.
But she took over again as he ordered and
gradually her vexation disappeared in her
effort to concentrate every faculty on the
job of flying the plane and keeping to her
course. She was gradually gaining confidence.
She made the same maneuvers
which had caused the skid before, and
carried through perfectly.</p>

<p>Bill told her so in no stinted terms, and
the last shreds of her anger disappeared.</p>

<p>"The man who put <i>me</i> over the bumps,"
he added, "always said: 'when a student
aviator makes a mistake, give him blazes--make
him mad. He'll remember what
he should have done all the better--and live
longer!' That advice applies to either sex,
Dorothy. Naturally, I hope you'll live to a
ripe old age."</p>

<p>Dorothy liked him for this apology. She
wanted to thank him but of course that was
out of the question.</p>

<p>"I'll take her over now." She heard his
even tones once more, above the engine's
roar. "Time for lunch. This afternoon,
if you like, we'll take up another end of this
business. And you can get even by teaching
me how to become an honest-to-goodness
sleuthhound!"</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch10' class='c007'><i>Chapter X</i><br />Â <br />THE MEETING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After lunch Dorothy and Bill established
themselves comfortably in the shade
of the terrace awning back of the Bolton's
house, and Dorothy's ground training began.</p>

<p>"First of all," said her instructor, "you
must learn the signals for maneuvers, such
as when the stick is shaken laterally, one
hand held up, it means control of the plane
is resumed by the instructor. Opening the
throttle in a glide means resume level
flight. There are eight of these signals to
memorize. Then there are eight correction
signals as well."</p>

<p>"I'll get them down soon enough," his
pupil assured him. "Is that all?"</p>

<p>"I should say not. That's just a starter.
Your ground training will consist of three
parts: theoretic training, which takes up
principles of flight; aircraft construction,
aviation engine construction; and the
elements of meteorology. Next, practical
training, which embraces the maintenance
and repair of aircraft together with maintenance
and repair of aviation engines.
Then comes aviation procedure, which
takes up air commerce regulations; instruction
procedure (signals come under
that) and precautions and general instructions."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Dorothy in dismay.
"It <i>is</i> a business!"</p>

<p>Bill laughed at her forlorn expression.
"Cheer up--the first hundred years are the
hardest. But seriously, to become an efficient
air pilot, it is essential to know thoroughly
this ground work and all of the
maneuvers I listed under elementary flying.
None of them can be safely omitted.
Of those I included under advanced flying,
acrobatics are not required for a pilot's
license, but they're a grand help in developing
ability to handle a plane with confidence.
Proficiency in reverse control flying,
precision landings with power,
forced landings and cross country flying
is required for an interstate commercial
license--and vital for every pilot."</p>

<p>"Is <i>that</i> all?" asked Dorothy, with diminished
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"No. To become a real flyer, you must
understand aerial navigation and pass off
formation flying and night flying. It
sounds like a lot--but it really isn't so difficult.
Of course, if you don't <i>want</i> to go
the whole way--"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I do, Bill," she said earnestly.
"It's only that I never dreamed there was
so much to be learned. It kind of takes
my breath away--"</p>

<p>"You mustn't let that bother you. I'm
glad you're going to do the thing up right,
though. It will take a lot of your time--but
you'll find it worth your while. Let's
get busy now. We'll start on signals.
Then later this afternoon you can go up
again if you feel like it."</p>

<p>For the next two weeks Dorothy worked
daily with Bill. By the end of that time she
had completed her elementary solo flying
and was now engrossed in mastering the
difficulties of reverse control.</p>

<p>Bill realized after giving her two or
three lessons, that his pupil showed a high
degree of aptitude for flying. Their trip
home in the amphibian after the wreck of
the <i>Scud</i>, had proved pretty conclusively
to him that this sixteen-year-old girl had an
unusually cool and stable temperament.
Ordinarily, flight training is inadvisable
for anyone under eighteen years of age,
and Bill knew that twenty years is preferable.
For, ordinarily, the instinctive coordination
between sensory organs and
muscles, which is necessary toward the
control of a plane in the air, does not develop
earlier. An airplane must be kept
moving or it will fall; and the processes of
reason are far too slow to keep up with the
exigencies of flight. Flying cannot be
figured out like a problem in mathematics.
Calculation won't do the trick--there isn't
enough time for it.</p>

<p>Of course there are exceptions to this
rule. Bill Bolton was one himself, and
Dorothy, he knew, was another.</p>

<p>When Mr. Dixon questioned him as to
Dorothy's progress, he gave him a list of
the maneuvers that had already been
mastered, and the approximate length of
time she had taken to satisfy him in performance.</p>

<p>"But that doesn't mean a thing to me--"
objected the older man. "Look here--I
was talking to a friend of mine who is an
old Royal Flying Corps man. He said
that Dorothy should wait several years before
training. How about it? I know
your reputation as a flyer, and I've proved
my confidence in you by trusting you with
my daughter's life. Why is it better for her
to start now, rather than later?"</p>

<p>"Do you play the violin, sir?"</p>

<p>"No ear for music." Mr. Dixon shook
his head in reminiscence. "My father
played well. It was his ambition that we
play duets together. But after wasting
money for two years on lessons for me, he
gave it up. My! the sounds I made when
I practiced! It must have been torture to
him. I can't tell one note from another--but
I remember how awful it was. But what
has <i>that</i> got to do with Dorothy's flying?"</p>

<p>"A good deal. You couldn't play the
violin because you are not musical, and
only a musical person can learn to play it
well. In some respects, mastery of the
violin and mastery of flying, have a common
bond. With both the one fundamental
requirement is natural or instinctive
aptitude. Flying is an art, and without
natural ability it is useless to attempt it.
And if it isn't inherent, Mr. Dixon, it just
can't be acquired. Moreover, the only
way to find out if that aptitude exists, is by
trial. If Dorothy had the natural ability
for the violin that she has for flying, practice
and experience would make her a
second Kreisler!"</p>

<p>A smile crept along the corners of Mr.
Dixon's mouth. "Ah, but Kreisler is a
<i>man</i>!"</p>

<p>"I know, sir, but honestly, sex has nothing to
do with it."</p>

<p>"So you think she should keep on with
her flight training?"</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> she should, Mr. Dixon, if you
want her to fly at all. She has all the qualifications
that go toward making a really
<i>good</i> air pilot."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to hear you say it, and
glad you're so enthusiastic."</p>

<p>"Of course I am," declared Bill. "She's
fearless and alert and she loves the work--she'll
do well."</p>

<p>And so Dorothy continued her flight
training.</p>

<p>She came down one afternoon from a
solo flight and Bill, who had been watching
her maneuvers from the shade of the
hangar, walked over as the plane rolled to
a stop.</p>

<p>"Not so good--" she called out as she
sprang to the ground. "I nearly overshot
my landing."</p>

<p>"So I noticed," returned her young instructor
rather grimly. "Carelessness,
you know, that's all. Keep your mind on
the job. And here's something else. Remember,
when you are making a flipper
turn, the nose must first be dropped to
level. Otherwise you'll get into serious
trouble. Also don't forget that until the
wings pass an angle of bank of 45 degrees
your controls are not inverted and must be
handled as in a normal turn."</p>

<p>"O.K. skipper," she sighed. "I'll remember
in future."</p>

<p>"One thing more. Those two 360-degree
spirals with an altitude loss of about
1000 feet were well done. But you must
bring your plane out of reverse control
spirals above 1500 feet altitude--Now
we'll put your bus away and call it a day."</p>

<p>Work finished, they strolled over to the
terrace where Frank as usual had iced
drinks awaiting them.</p>

<p>"You've certainly taught me a lot in
fourteen days," observed Dorothy after
sipping her ginger ale. "But it's kind of
put a crimp into our detective work. By
the way, you never have told me what you
had up your sleeve with regard to the
robbery--something to do with an
airplane coming in handy, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Your memory is better on the ground
than in the air!"</p>

<p>"Pish! likewise, tush! You don't intend
to wait till I finish training or anything like
that, before coming across with that clue
that will help us land those birds in jail?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Thought maybe you
might figure my interest in landing the
gang would take my mind off flying--"</p>

<p>Bill took a long, refreshing drink of the
iced liquid at his elbow. "You're on the
wrong track. I'm simply biding my time
and keeping a finger on the pulse of the
robbery, as it were."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that?"</p>

<p>"I'm in deadly earnest," he assured her,
although his eyes twinkled mischievously.</p>

<p>"Then all I can say," exclaimed
Dorothy, "is that you're one up on everybody
else who is working on the case."</p>

<p>"How come?"</p>

<p>"Why? you know as well as I do that
when the Packard rolled out of the alley
by the bank, in all probability carrying
three people and the loot, it disappeared
completely. And it's stayed that way ever
since, hasn't it? That's two weeks ago tonight."</p>

<p>"Any new clues lately?"</p>

<p>"Nary a one. The police traced the red-headed
girl's finger prints to Sarah Martinelli,
better known as Staten Island
Sadie. They sent Dad her record--I saw
it--believe me, that lady is a ripe egg!"</p>

<p>"How beautifully expressive."</p>

<p>Dorothy raised her eyes from her compact's
tiny mirror.</p>

<p>"Well, she must be!--Are you trying to
kid me?"</p>

<p>Bill finished his ginger ale. "Come on,
tell me the rest."</p>

<p>Dorothy grinned. "That's all there is,
there isn't any more, my child. Don't
imagine those police are efficient, do you?
None of the missing bonds have been
found, and as for the money, those chaps
have probably spent it by this time. I feel
awfully sorry for Daddy, though," she
continued in a changed voice, "--that Mrs.
Hamberfield is still raising the roof about
her diamond necklace. Serves her right
for being such a mutt, I say."</p>

<p>"Tough on both parties, I should think."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind. Daddy says that
her husband, Stonington Hamberfield,
made his coin profiteering during the war.
What do you think his name really is?"</p>

<p>"You tell me."</p>

<p>"Steinburg Hammerfeld--isn't that a
hot one?"</p>

<p>"A Hun, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, if he isn't--I'm President Hindenburg,
San Francisco Harbor and the
Statue of Liberty all in one!"</p>

<p>Bill smiled appreciatively at this sally,
then changed the subject. "Let's go to
the movies this evening?"</p>

<p>"Can't. It's Pen and Pencil Club
night."</p>

<p>"What on earth is that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about a year ago, a bunch of us at
high school, girls and fellows, started a
club to write short stories. We meet every
other Tuesday night at some member's
house. Everybody has to write a story at
least one a month, or they're fined a quarter.
We read aloud and discuss them at the
meeting. Come with me after supper and
pay my quarter."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing. That kind of thing is
my idea of a perfectly terrible evening."</p>

<p>Dorothy slipped the compact into a
pocket of her jodhpurs and got to her feet.</p>

<p>"That's where you're all wrong, Bill.
Noel Sainsbury, the writer, is our adviser.
He makes it awfully interesting--we have
lots of fun. He was a naval aviator during
the war. You two should have lots in common.
Do come along and meet him."</p>

<p>"Why I dined at his place, Little Windows,
last night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you do know him?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. Where would I be if it
weren't for him? Look at the books he's
written about me. Noel Sainsbury brought
Dad and me to New Canaan. We're
awfully fond of him and his wife and little
girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, Winks is a darling and Mrs. Sainsbury
is a peach--" Dorothy agreed. "She
comes to our meetings, too. I'm named
for her, you know."</p>

<p>"Really? That's interesting."</p>

<p>"You bet. Then you'll come tonight?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to, very much."</p>

<p>"All right. The meeting is at Betty
Mayo's, in White Oak Shade. I'll be here
about eight in my car and drive you down
there."</p>

<p>"I'll be ready--so long!"</p>

<p>"So long!"</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p>It was nearly quarter to nine before they
got started, as things turned out. Mr.
Dixon had gone to New York for the day
on business, had been detained in town,
and Dorothy waited dinner for him.</p>

<p>"Well, we won't have missed much," she
explained to Bill as her car breasted the
Marvin Ridge Road. "The first half hour
is always taken up with the minutes of the
last meeting and all that parliamentary
stuff. I love driving in the twilight, anyway.
Next place on the left is where we're
bound. We'll be there in a jiffy."</p>

<p>They rounded a bend and came upon a
Packard parked at the roadside. The hood
was up and a man looked up from tinkering
with the engine as their lights outlined
his figure.</p>

<p>"Pull up! pull up!" Bill's tense whisper
sounded in her ears. "Where are your
eyes, girl?"</p>

<p>But Dorothy needed no second warning.
She shot home the brake, for she too had
seen the great, misshapen boot that the
dapper little motorist wore on his left foot.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch11' class='c007'><i>Chapter XI</i><br />Â <br />FOLLOW THE LEADER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"Need any help?" inquired Bill, as
Dorothy drew up opposite the Packard.</p>

<p>"Thanks! This thing has got me
stumped. I'm not much of a mechanician,"
returned the lame man ruefully. "Do you
know anything about motors?"</p>

<p>"Making them behave is my long suit,"
was Bill's glib retort as he alighted from
the car and crossed the road. "Let's see
if I can locate your trouble. Got plenty
of gas?"</p>

<p>"Lots of it. I just looked to see."</p>

<p>"Then let me have your flashlight while
I give her the once over."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute--" called Dorothy, "I'll
swing this car round and put my lights on
the engine. There--is that better?" she
ended, trying to keep the excitement out
of her voice.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be sweeter!" sang out
Bill without turning his head. "Hold her
as you are."</p>

<p>Dorothy's offer had not been quite so altruistic
as it sounded, for now her lights
brilliantly illuminated the two figures
bending over the Packard's engine. While
Bill went over the motor with the sureness
of an expert, keeping up a desultory conversation
with the stranger, Dorothy used
her eyes to good advantage.</p>

<p>But after a while she grew impatient.
Why didn't Bill capture the man at once
so they could haul him off to the police station?
Why did he continue to go on with
his pretended inspection of the engine?
He couldn't really be in earnest, for if he
found the trouble and fixed it, the lame
man would simply get in his car and drive
away. Could it be that Bill wasn't sure of
his quarry? Of course, he was clean
shaven, although Lizzie had described
him as having a small mustache. Naturally,
he'd shave it off. By this time he
must know that his description had been
broadcast. And so far as she could see the
earrings were missing too. But that was
to be expected. And he spoke good English
with a slight Italian accent.</p>

<p>What was the matter with Bill! He was
big enough to take care of the man with
one hand, when all he did was tinker and
jabber. What was the use of that?</p>

<p>"Your engine seems to be in A-1 condition,"
Bill was saying. "Doesn't look
as if you'd been running the car lately."</p>

<p>"I haven't," replied the lame man. "She
ran like a charm when I drove down here
earlier this evening. Then all of a sudden
she stops--and won't go on."</p>

<p>"Ah! here we are!" Bill exclaimed a moment
later. "You've got a choked jet. I'll
fix that in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," beamed the Italian.
"Is that a serious trouble?"</p>

<p>"Not so bad. Buy better gas and have
your carburetor well looked over. I'll fix
it so the car will move, though."</p>

<p>"Do you think she will run fifty miles?"</p>

<p>"Sure--but there are plenty of garages
nearer than that if you want to fix it."</p>

<p>"I'll wait until I reach home. My friend--he
will give the engine a thorough going
over. He understands very well such
things."</p>

<p>"Good enough." Bill straightened his
back and closed the hood. "You're O.K.
now. She'll run."</p>

<p>"Then thank you so much. You have
been very kind."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it." Bill waved farewell
and crossed the road as the lame man
climbed into his car and drove off in the
direction of New Canaan village.</p>

<p>"What ever <i>is</i> the matter with you?"
Dorothy broke out in a fever of angry disappointment.
"Why didn't you nab him
while you had the chance? Now he'll get
away and--"</p>

<p>"Hush, sister! Likewise calm yourself,"
cut in Bill. "Move over. I'm going
to drive. This business isn't finished by a
long shot. It has only just begun."</p>

<p>Dorothy, flabbergasted by his high-handed
manner, slid across the seat as he
directed, and Bill sprang in behind the
wheel. The tail light of the Packard disappeared
around the bend of the road.</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" she fumed.</p>

<p>"Wait till we get going, Dot." Bill
threw in the reverse and started to turn the
car in the direction from which they had
come a quarter of an hour before.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i> call me 'Dot'! You know I
won't stand for it. Aren't you the limit--Going
to try to trail him, I suppose, when
you could have nailed him right here!"</p>

<p>"Don't get peeved!" Bill swung the
little car onto the road and switching off
his lights brought his foot down on the
accelerator. "I know what I'm doing."</p>

<p>"<i>Well, maybe</i> you do." Her voice was
full of sarcasm. "But we might just as well
go back to the Pen and Pencil meeting.
You'll never catch up with his bus."</p>

<p>"Shan't try to. There's his tail light
now!" They rounded the turn and Bill
sent the car streaking along the black road
like a terrified cat up a back alley.
"There's no need to get snippy," he added.
"You heard what our friend said about <i>his</i>
friend--who understands all about engines?
On a bet, that's the lad who wore
the chauffeur's cap and beaned the night
watchman. He said he'd let him look over
the carburetor when he got home, didn't
he? And like as not that ripe egg lady--the
one with the red head--will be there
too!"</p>

<p>"Staten Island Sadie?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," admitted Dorothy. "The
lame man <i>was</i> alone in his car. But you
stand a good chance of losing him, even if
he doesn't see us. We'll have to switch on
the lights going through towns."</p>

<p>"But, you see, I'm pretty sure I know
where he's bound for."</p>

<p>"You do?" Her surprise drove all petulance
from her tone.</p>

<p>"That's what I've kept up my sleeve. If
he takes the Ridgefield Road, out of New
Canaan, then I'm certain of it."</p>

<p>"Better switch on the glims again," she
advised. "We'll crash or get a ticket running
without them in this South Main
Street traffic--we're nearly in the village
now. I can spot the Packard ahead there."
Then, contritely, she continued: "Sorry
I was peeved, Bill, old thing. I didn't understand.
Forgive me--and let's hear all
about it."</p>

<p>"Of course--hello!" he cried. "He's
slowed down. Confound it, anyway.
That comes of talking and not keeping
my mind on the job. I'll bet he has his
suspicions. Wants to see if we're following--nothing
dumb about that bird. I
shouldn't have driven so close. He'll
tumble to a certainty if we slow up too."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Give me time--" he answered grimly.
"Confound again! There goes the red
light on the Library corner! Now we're
in for it."</p>

<p>"P'raps he won't notice us," said
Dorothy hopefully as they drew up behind
the Packard.</p>

<p>"Not a chance. But we'll fool him yet.
Let me do the talking," he whispered as the
lame man thrust his head out of the car and
looked back at them.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" cried Bill cheerfully.
"I see you've got this far without another
breakdown!"</p>

<p>"Good evening, my friend," replied the
Italian. "This is a surprise. I thought you
were going the other way."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Just ran down there to leave
a message." Bill's tone was affability itself.
"You must have come pretty slowly.
How's the car running?"</p>

<p>"Nicely, thank you."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid to let her out. Well--there's
the light. Excuse me if I pass you,"
he said airly. "We're in a hurry. So
long."</p>

<p>"Au revoir ..." Dorothy added gaily
and waved her hand as Bill swung to the
left, then headed up Main Street in advance
of the Packard.</p>

<p>"Aren't you smart! You'll get us into a
heap of trouble yet with your 'au revoirs'!"</p>

<p>"Hey, there"--she cried. They were
rolling swiftly up the hill past the bank.</p>

<p>"You should have turned right then
left, for Ridgefield--back at the last
corner!"</p>

<p>Bill laughed. "Old Angel Face did just
as I figured," he informed her, still chuckling.
"I spotted him making the turn, in
the glass."</p>

<p>"Where are we going? Sure you haven't
lost him?"</p>

<p>"Listen. That chap is heading for
Ridgefield. From there he will run another
ten miles up to Danbury. Unless I'm
completely wet, his objective is a certain
house in the hills on a back road, over
toward the New York borderline about
twenty-five miles north. It's a rough, wild
stretch of country, with Pawling, N. Y., to
the west and New Milford, Connecticut,
on the east, that he's heading for. Nice
riding too, dirt roads, mere trails that
haven't had a scraper on them since the
Revolution. That house I just told you
about is a good ten miles from a railroad as
a plane flies--probably twice as far by
road."</p>

<p>"Interesting--but why are we heading
this way?"</p>

<p>"Simply because it is too dangerous to
follow that lad just now. He smells a rat
and is sure to park in some dark spot along
the way to make certain he's not being followed."</p>

<p>"Then what <i>are</i> we going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to run west over to Bedford,
New York. Then north from there
through Golden Bridge and Croton Falls
to Brewster. From Brewster I'll keep to
the same state road north toward Pawling.
But just before I get to Patterson, there's a
dirt road that turns off into the hills to the
northeast. That's the one I'll follow.
Eventually, I'll get to the house. Angel
Face's route is shorter--but I'll get there
soon after he does, if he stops along the
way to see if anyone's after him. First of
all I'll drop you at your house and get myself
a gat."</p>

<p>"You'd better get two--for I'm coming
with you."</p>

<p>"Sorry, my girl--this is a man's job."</p>

<p>Dorothy turned and stared at him.
"Well--of all the consummate nerve--"
she began.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Dot--it just can't be. I've got no
right to let you run the risk."</p>

<p>"Don't you <i>dare</i> to 'Dot' me again!"
Miss Dixon was distinctly irritated. "And
what's more, if you try to ditch me, I'll
phone the police station and spill everything.
They'll pick you up at Bedford
and horn in, of course--and like as not,
they'll gum it all."</p>

<p>"If you talk that way, I suppose I'll have
to take you."</p>

<p>"Of course you will. Say, Bill, that was
only a bluff, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Bill smiled. "Perhaps. But it's a risky
business."</p>

<p>"No worse than learning to fly, is it?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-fifty, I should say."</p>

<p>"That's settled, then. What I can't understand
is why you didn't corral that gang
long before this--or at least put the police
on to them, if you knew where they were
all the time."</p>

<p>"But that's just it--they haven't been in
the house since the robbery. I've driven
up there several times and reconnoitered
from the air as well."</p>

<p>"Then what makes you think you'll corner
the gang at the house now?"</p>

<p>The car turned in the Dixon's drive and
came to a stop by the side entrance.</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait till the next chapter
for that," he laughed. "Time is worth
more than money now. I'll tell you all
about it when we get going again. Beat
it upstairs now and change that light dress
for breeches and a dark sweater or coat.
I'll run across the road for something more
suitable and less conspicuous than white
flannels."</p>

<p>"O.K." Dorothy sprang out of the car.
"Don't forget our armory."</p>

<p>"Not a chance. Now forget the prinking
and make it snappy," he sang out,
backing down the driveway.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch12' class='c007'><i>Chapter XII</i><br />Â <br />THE HOUSE IN THE HILLS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"Don't tell me it takes a girl long to
change her clothes!" was Dorothy's salutation,
as Bill drove up to the side entrance
again. "You've kept me waiting here exactly
three minutes and a half."</p>

<p>"Sorry," he said in mock contrition.
"Fact is, I thought we'd better use my own
bus tonight and I had to go out to the garage
to get it."</p>

<p>"What's the big idea?" Dorothy sprang
in beside him, looking very trim and boyish
in jodhpurs and dark flannel shirt over
which she wore a thin brown sweater.
"Isn't my car good enough for you?"</p>

<p>"This boat has a full tank," he replied
tersely. "Can't waste time tonight picking
up gas."</p>

<p>They had reversed the car down the
drive and were now speeding along the
tree-lined road in the direction of Bedford.</p>

<p>"Got my gun?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know!" Bill passed
over a small revolver in a holster. "Tie
yourself to that! It's a Colt .32 and it's
loaded. Know how to use it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. What do you expect me to
do--release the safety catch and pull the
trigger to see if it works?" Her tone flared
hotly with indignation.</p>

<p>Bill whistled a tuneless air, but the whistle
developed into a laugh and the laugh
continued until Dorothy snapped:</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i> cackle like a billygoat!"</p>

<p>"Billygoats don't--" he began but broke
off, changing his bantering tone. "Then
why do you tie the leg-strap around your
waist?" he asked seriously enough.</p>

<p>She swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"Because--well, because I've never used
this kind of a holster before, smarty. But
I can shoot--Daddy taught me--I can box,
too, and I've had lessons in jiu jitsu. Oh,
I can take care of myself, if that's what's
worrying you!"</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it, Dorothy. Excitement
kind of stirs you up eh?"</p>

<p>"It's not excitement that does it, Bill--it's
suspense. But I'm sorry I bawled you
out."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it. My humble apologies
for being so rude--"</p>

<p>"Imbecile! You weren't. But never
mind that--tell me about this house in the
woods and what it has to do with the gang
who robbed the bank."</p>

<p>The car ran into Bedford and taking
the turn to the right, he swung on to the
northbound turnpike.</p>

<p>"Go ahead with the story," begged
Dorothy as they left the picturesque village
behind.</p>

<p>"Right-o! Here goes. On our way
back from the South last month, I dropped
Dad at New Orleans. The old <i>Loening</i>
needed a thorough overhauling, so Dad
left me there with the plane and went north
by train. After I saw him off at the L. and
N. station, I went back to the St. Charles
Hotel and slept for nearly twenty-four
hours. I got a touch of jungle fever when
I was down in the cypress swamps and was
still feeling pretty rocky.</p>

<p>"So for the next ten days I loafed while
the amphibian got what was coming to her.
When she'd been made shipshape again I
flew her north. I was in no hurry to reach
New Canaan and stopped off at Atlanta,
and at Philadelphia, where I have friends.</p>

<p>"A couple of days before I met you I
started on the last leg of the hop. It was
raining when I left Philly--a filthy morning,
with high fog along the coast. That
is why I decided not to follow the New
York-Philadelphia-Hartford air route, but
cut straight north over eastern Pennsylvania
and northern New Jersey, hoping
for better visibility inland. Instead, the
old bus ran me into even worse weather.
The fog grew lower and denser and flying
conditions became even rottener than before.
You haven't run into fog in a plane,
yet, Dorothy--and, believe me, it's no fun.</p>

<p>"I expected to cross the Hudson at about
Haverstraw and fly east to New Canaan.
I know now that I must have overshot that
burg; that the plane was probably nearer
Newburgh when we crossed the river and
headed east. To make matters worse, a few
minutes later, the engine commenced to
skip. I began to realize then that I didn't
know where I was."</p>

<p>Dorothy had been listening intently, her
eyes on the grotesque shadows cast by their
headlights upon the stone fences along the
road; now she turned and stared at him in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"That's a good one! You've flown
pretty much all over the country--and get
lost in dear little Connecticut!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know--parts of the state
are as wild as the Canadian woods! And
just remember that the visibility at five
hundred feet was so poor I could hardly
see the nose of my plane. And worse luck,
I knew that with the engine cutting up the
way she was, I'd soon be forced to land."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Nosed over until I got almost down to
the trees on the hilltops. Visibility was
better there, but for the life of me I
couldn't spot a landing place.--Nothing
but one chain of hills after another, all
covered with trees. The sides of these foothills
of the Berkshires are steep as church
roofs--and they run down to narrow,
densely wooded valleys. Well, for some
time I circled about with the engine acting
worse every split second. Then, in a
valley a little wider than any I'd come
across so far, I saw the glint of water--a
little lake. Fifty yards or so away, there
was a good-sized farmhouse with a fairly
level hay field behind it. I chose the lake,
although it wasn't much better than a duck
pond--and landed.</p>

<p>"The house was a ramshackle affair, but
some smoke rose from the chimney, so I
figured someone lived there. While I was
fixing my engine, a girl--or rather I should
say a young woman--came out of the
house and walked down to the little dock
near where the plane was floating."</p>

<p>"Of course she had red hair and wore
yellow beach pajamas?" said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"She did--I mean, she had. Anyway,
when Lizzie described the girl in the car
who wanted bicarbonate of soda and got
it, I was sure that my er--lady of the lake
and she were one and the same."</p>

<p>"Did you talk to her?"</p>

<p>"I did. I told her I was lost and asked
her where I had come down. She told me,
after a while. That is, she gave me a general
idea in what direction Danbury lay
and about how far away from town we
were. But I thought at the time that she
was awfully cagy and tight with her information."</p>

<p>"In other words, she didn't seem especially
glad to see you?"</p>

<p>"That's it. Instead of inviting me ashore
and up to the house for a meal, she wanted
to know how long I was likely to be on the
lake--and then she beat it back to the
house. Naturally, I thought it queer she
should be so inhospitable and stand-offish.
People are usually interested anyway,
when a plane arrives unexpectedly in their
neighborhood--too darn interested, if anything.
Still, I didn't think much about
her, then. I had the information I wanted,
and after changing a couple of sparkplugs,
I took off and made New Canaan
via Danbury without any more trouble."</p>

<p>"Did you see anyone besides the girl
with the red hair?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul."</p>

<p>"And you've been back since the robbery,
I think you said?"</p>

<p>"Several times. But the place has been
deserted and the house locked up tighter
than a drum."</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"Why do you think the gang are there
now?" asked Dorothy. "Simply because
we saw the lame man take the Ridgefield
road?"</p>

<p>"This is the way I figured." They had
passed through the little town of Brewster,
heading north, some minutes before. Now
Bill turned the car off the state highway
and on to a winding dirt road full of deep
ruts that he knew ran far into the wooded
hill country to the northeast. "It is my
idea," he continued, slowing down to a
bare twenty-mile pace, "that after the robbery,
that gang scattered and laid low for
a while. They didn't go to the house, that
I do know. After you went to bed that
night, I drove up here to have a look-see.
Nobody home, as I've told you. But they
couldn't have a better place for headquarters.
There isn't a house anywhere
round that neck of the woods. Sooner or
later, they're bound to meet there. The
loot has got to be divided. Seeing our
lame friend headed in that direction this
evening makes me doubly certain. I've
kept it to myself, because if that army of
detectives who are on this case started
camping out near the house on a watchful
waiting spree, those crooks would be sure
to spot them and never show up."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," she said.</p>

<p>For some time neither spoke, while their
car bumped slowly along the uneven road.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose that lame man
was doing on Marvin Ridge?" she inquired
presently.</p>

<p>"Search me. How should I know?
You certainly love to fire questions at a
guy."</p>

<p>"He told us the car hadn't been used
lately," she mused, ignoring his remark.</p>

<p>"That only goes to prove we're right in
thinking he has been in hiding somewhere."</p>

<p>"But where?"</p>

<p>"Merciful heaven! Another question!
That road runs down to Noroton, doesn't
it? And from there the Boston Post could
bring him from all points east and west.
There's no telling where he'd come from."</p>

<p>"But I drove up from the Post Road that
way yesterday. It has been freshly oiled
to within a half mile of where we met him.
Yet that Packard hadn't run through oil.
If she had, I'd have seen it with my headlights
smack on her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he came down a side road?"</p>

<p>"Not between that point and the oil--there
isn't any."</p>

<p>"Maybe he'd been calling in the neighborhood--"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly--I know everyone who
lives along that road."</p>

<p>"You think it out then--I've got enough
to do trying to navigate this road. I'm going
to switch out the lights, now. We're
not more than a couple of miles from the
house."</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll put up much of a
fight?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord! You don't think I've any
intention of trying to capture them?" Bill
exclaimed. He was very busily engaged
in keeping the car in the middle of the
grass grown trail as it rolled, down a steep
hillside at a snail's pace. "I'm not taking
chances with you along. It would be foolish
to attempt anything like that. You'll
get into no battles tonight, miss. This is
just a scouting party. If the gang have
arrived, we'll beat it back to Brewster and
get the cops on the job."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>dear</i>!" sighed Dorothy. "And I
thought this was going to be the real
thing!"</p>

<p>"No grandstand plays for you tonight,
young lady. What's more--I'm running
this show. If you don't promise to behave,
you'll warm a seat in this car, while I mosey
up to the house. How about it?"</p>

<p>Dorothy's voice betrayed her disgust
and disappointment.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll promise. But if we are leaving
all the fun to the police, why did you bring
the guns?"</p>

<p>"Because you seemed to expect them,
little brighteyes. But we might as well
have left them home, for all the use they'll
be--I'll see to that. It's bad enough to be
forced into bringing you up here. Your
father will certainly raise the roof when he
finds it out. I shan't tell him, that's flat."</p>

<p>"You believe in being candid!" with cutting
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"You bet. And please remember that if
you try to pull off anything you'll probably
crab the show. And get us into a good old-fashioned
mess besides."</p>

<p>He stopped the car and slipping into reverse
gear, backed off the trail.</p>

<p>"There!" He switched off the ignition.
"We're all ready for a quick getaway if
need be."</p>

<p>"How far are we from the house?" she
asked in a tense whisper.</p>

<p>"About a mile. I'm afraid to drive
nearer--sound carries a long way up these
quiet valleys. Let's get started now. I
want you to walk just behind me. Be careful
where you place your feet. We'll follow
the trail a while farther, but it's pretty
rough going. Above all else--don't talk--and
make just as little noise as possible."</p>

<p>"What if they have sentries posted?" she
asked, coming to his side.</p>

<p>"Aren't you the limit!" Bill seemed
really annoyed. "There you go talking
again! For your satisfaction, though--if
we have the bad luck to come across anyone,
I'll naturally do my best to scrag him.
You, of course, will act as you think best.
My advice is to beat it to the car, as fast as
you can. Come along now--and quiet!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you horrid tonight!" she
breathed, swinging up the overgrown trail
behind him.</p>

<p>But Bill didn't hear her. Anyway, he
didn't answer, and she followed in his footsteps
while a pleasurable thrill of excitement
gradually took the place of her disappointment.
It was nearly pitch dark,
walking along in the shadow of tall trees
that lined the twisting path. Now and then
the cry of a night bird came to her from the
woods, but except for the dull sound of their
steps on the damp earth--the occasional
snapping of a twig underfoot, all was quiet
in the forest.</p>

<p>Bill was only a blur in the gloom ahead.
But she was glad to know he was there just
the same. This creeping through the still
night to reconnoiter a gang of bank-thieves
held a kick all its own. Yes, she was glad
that Bill was close by.</p>

<p>There came a movement in the underbrush
behind them. Hands of steel caught
her arms, pinning them to her sides.</p>

<p>"Sentries, Bill!" she screamed, struggling
frantically to free herself. "Look
out! <i>Look out!</i>"</p>

<p>She heard Bill mutter angrily. Heavy
feet crashed in the brush and she heard the
sharp impact of a solid fist meeting soft
flesh. Several men were shouting now and
someone groaned.</p>

<p>Bending suddenly forward and sideways,
Dorothy managed to fasten her teeth
on the wrist of the man who held her. With
a howl, he let go her right arm and at the
same time a gun went off. The night was
torn with a scream of anguish. But before
she could use her free arm someone dropped
a bag over her head, a rope was knotted
about her wrists and a muffled voice spoke
to her through the folds of the sack.</p>

<p>"<i>Be</i>have, sister! <i>Be</i>have, I say, or I'll
crack yer wid dis rod. I ain't no wild cat
tamer. Quiet now, or I'll bash yer one!"</p>

<p>Inasmuch as it was no part of Dorothy's
plan to get "bashed" in a bag, that young
lady kept quiet.</p>

<p>"That's the girl!" he applauded. Swinging
her over his shoulder as though she
were a sack of flour, he walked away from
the scuffle on the trail.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch13' class='c007'><i>Chapter XIII</i><br />Â <br />TRAPPED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The burlap sack was stiflingly hot.
Moreover it seemed impregnated with fine
particles of dust which burned her throat
and nostrils and set her coughing.
Dorothy was frightfully uncomfortable.
Breathing became more and more difficult.</p>

<p>"Let me go--I'm smothering!" she
gasped.</p>

<p>"And get another piece bit out of me
arm?" snorted her captor. "Nothin'
doin'."</p>

<p>"But I'm choking to death in this filthy
bag! It's full of dust!"</p>

<p>"Keep yer mouth shut, then," gruffed
the man. "And stop that wrigglin'. I'll
tap yer one if yer don't. What do ye think
this is, anyway--a joy ride?"</p>

<p>"But--" she began again.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" he growled. "Behave, will
yer? Say, sister, if I had me way youse'd
get bumped off right now. Give me more
of yer lip and I'll do it, anyway!"</p>

<p>There was a grim menace in the gangster's
tone that frightened Dorothy more
than his words. Thereafter she spoke no
more. She even refrained from struggling,
although her head swam and his
grip of iron about her knees had become
torture.</p>

<p>What had happened to Bill, she wondered,
and cold fear entered her heart. She
was almost certain that it had been a blow
from his fist she had heard directly after
her warning shout. But the shot and the
scream immediately afterward? Had that
been the sound of his automatic--or another's?
The thought of Bill lying in the
woods wounded--perhaps dead--drove
her frantic. Yet she was powerless, with
her wrists lashed behind her back. While
the man who carried her lurched forward,
stumbling now and then over the uneven
ground, each step causing his victim fresh
agony, Dorothy's conviction of hopelessness
assailed and overwhelmed the last
shreds of her fighting spirit. She wept.</p>

<p>Presently,--it seemed an age,--she
sensed that the gangster was mounting a
flight of steps. There came the creak of a
board underfoot. Then she knew that he
was fumbling with a doorknob. A glow
of light appeared through the burlap.</p>

<p>"Here we are, sister!" he grunted, with
evident relief. Swinging her from his
shoulder, he placed Dorothy on her feet
and pulled off the sack.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" he exclaimed, steadying her as
she would have fallen, "I thought it was
a Mack truck I was carryin'. But you're
only a kid! Nobody'd think you weighed
so much. Did I make you cry?"</p>

<p>He placed an arm under her elbow and
led her to a chair. It was of the hard,
straight-backed, kitchen variety, but
Dorothy was only too glad to sit down and
rest. She kept her eyes closed, for the light,
after the dark confines of the bag, was
blinding. Her breath came in convulsive
gasps.</p>

<p>"Feelin' kind of woozy?" The man's
tone was callous, but at least it evinced a
slight interest in her condition and she
took advantage of that at once.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," she admitted, keeping her
eyes closed, but drawing deep breaths of
air into her lungs between words. "You
nearly smothered me in that filthy bag. If
you want to make up for it, you can bring
me a drink of water now."</p>

<p>"You certainly have some noive! Y'
don't happen ter want a couple of ice cubes
and a stick in it too?"</p>

<p>"Plain water, if you please."</p>

<p>"Dat's all you'll get, kid. But I'm dry
myself, so I'll bring you some."</p>

<p>She heard him cross the room, jerk open
a door and tramp over an uncarpeted
floor beyond.</p>

<p>Dorothy opened her eyes.</p>

<p>A wave of faintness swept over her and
the room seemed to whirl before her. As
she tried to struggle to her feet she found
her roped hands had been securely fastened
to the back of her chair. She sank back
wearily, her thoughts in wild confusion.</p>

<p>After a moment she turned her attention
to her surroundings, conscious of the
futility of any further effort to free herself,
and resolved to bide her time.</p>

<p>The long, narrow room evidently ran
the width of the house for shuttered windows
broke the bare expanse of walls at
either end. Behind her chair, she knew,
was the door through which she had been
carried into the room, with shuttered windows
flanking it. Facing her were two
other doors, one open and one closed.
Through the open door came the sound
of a hand pump in action, where her captor
was drawing water.</p>

<p>The room in which she sat was dimly
lighted by an oil lamp, its chimney badly
smoked and unshaded. It stood on an unpainted
table amidst the debris of dirty
dishes and an unfinished meal. Chairs
pushed back at odd angles from the table
gave further evidence of the diners' hurried
exit.</p>

<p>"They must have posted someone further
down the road," she mused. "I wonder
how he got word to the house so
quickly?"</p>

<p>Then she caught sight of a wall-phone
in the shadows at the farther end of the
room. "Telephone, of course! They must
have planted one somewhere this side of
the turnpike. The man on watch saw our
car pass and immediately sent word along
the wire!"</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to Dorothy that
she herself might find that telephone useful.
For a moment she contemplated dragging
her chair across the room, but gave
up the idea almost at once, for the sound of
the pump in the room beyond had ceased
and she heard the gangster's returning
footsteps.</p>

<p>He appeared in the doorway almost immediately.
A broad-shouldered, narrow
hipped, sinewy young man, with a shock
of sandy hair falling over his ferret-like
eyes. The white weal of an old knife scar
marred the left side of his face from temple
to chin. An ugly, though not bad humored
countenance, she summed up--certainly
an easy one to remember.</p>

<p>"Here yer are, sister!" was his greeting.
"Get outside o' this an' yer'll feel
like a new woman!"</p>

<p>He held a brimming glass of fresh water
to her lips.</p>

<p>Dorothy gulped eagerly.</p>

<p>"Hey, there! Not so fast," he cautioned.
"You'll choke to death and Sadie'll swear
I done yer in." He pulled the glass out of
her reach. "Tastes good, eh?"</p>

<p>"It certainly does. Give me some more."</p>

<p>"Take it easy, then. I don't want yer
to get sick on this job." He grinned and
allowed her to finish drinking. "I guess
yer ain't used to a dump like this--" he
waved his hand toward the litter on the
table and included the peeling wall-paper.</p>

<p>"Still, it's a heap better than a hole in the
ground out in the woods. You certainly
are the lucky girl!" He grimaced, then
laughed heartily at his joke.</p>

<p>Dorothy's tone was stern, "What have
they done with Bill?"</p>

<p>"Who's Bill? Yer boy friend?"</p>

<p>"Is he hurt?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. He sure gave Tony a nasty
crack. A rough little guy, he is--some
scrapper. It looked like a battle royal to
me when I left an' brung yer up here. But
don't get the wrong idea, kid. By this
time, one of the bunch has slipped a knife
into him--pretty slick at that sort o' thing,
they are."</p>

<p>Dorothy said nothing, but he read her
feelings in her face.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, sister," he said, heaping a
plate with baked beans and sitting down
at the table. "Pardon me, if I finish supper.
That lad ain't so hot. You've got me
now, haven't yer? I'm a better man than
he was, Gunga Din!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are--I <i>don't</i> think!"</p>

<p>"How do yer get that way?"</p>

<p>"Well--" Dorothy eyed him uncompromisingly--"why
are you afraid of me,
then?"</p>

<p>"<i>Afraid?</i> You little whippet!" He
paused, his knife loaded with beans half
way to his mouth. "Say--that's a good
one! What are yer givin' us?"</p>

<p>"You keep me tied up, don't you? Why?
You're twice my size and you've got a
gun--"</p>

<p>"Two of 'em, little one--my rod and
yourn."</p>

<p>"Yet you're afraid to loosen my hands."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not--but--"</p>

<p>"Please," she begged, changing her
tone. "My face itches terribly from all that
dust and I--"</p>

<p>"Well, what do yer think I am? A lady's
maid?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly--I just hate to sit here
talking to you, looking such a fright!"</p>

<p>"So that's it," he laughed. "Don't try yer
Blarney on me! I'm as ugly as mud and
yer knows it. Though I'll say yer need a
little make-up--and I'll let yer have it.
But just get rid of that idea that you've
got me buffaloed--yer haven't!"</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair and coming
round the table, untied the rope that bound
her wrists.</p>

<p>"Thanks." She began to rub her hands,
which were numbed and sore.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," he leered. "Now
yer can doll up to yer heart's content while
I shovel some more chow into me. I sure
am empty an' that's no lie!"</p>

<p>"Hey, Mike!" called a man's voice from
the doorway behind her. "Where do they
keep the wheelbarrer in this godforsakin'
dump?"</p>

<p>"In the shed out back," returned Mike,
sliding his chair up to the table again and
picking up his knife. "What yer want it
for? What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Trouble enough!" grumbled the other.
"There's a couple o' guys messed up pretty
bad down the line. Need somethin' to cart
'em up here in. Sling me a hunk o' bread,
will yer? I ain't had no chow."</p>

<p>"Tough luck!" Mike replied callously,
his mouth full, and tossed him half a loaf.
"So long."</p>

<p>"So long--" sang out the other, and
Dorothy heard him cross the porch and
thump down the steps.</p>

<p>She was busily engaged in flexing her
stiff fingers. She began to feel better,
stronger, quite like her old self again. But
the news that two men were badly hurt was
anything but comforting. Was Bill one
of them? she wondered.</p>

<p>With an effort, she thrust the thought
from her, and drawing forth a comb and
a compact from a pocket, she commenced
the complicated process of making herself
presentable. If she was to make her escape
before the rest of the gang arrived she must
work fast. But not too fast, for every second
brought back renewed strength to her
cramped arms and fingers.</p>

<p>"How's that?" she asked a few minutes
later, replacing comb and compact in her
pocket and getting to her feet.</p>

<p>"Say! You're some looker! I'd never
have thought it!"</p>

<p>Mike pushed back his chair and came
toward her, wiping his mouth with the
back of a hand. "Say! You've got Sadie
lashed to the silo!"</p>

<p>"Who's Sadie? Your steady?" she
asked, playfully pointing a forefinger at
him.</p>

<p>Mike leaned back against the table.
"Never mind Sadie," he retorted. "I've
got an idea."</p>

<p>"Spill it."</p>

<p>"You wanta breeze--get outa here, don't
yer?"</p>

<p>"What a mind-reader!"</p>

<p>"Cut it, kid!" Mike's tone was tense
with earnestness. "That guy you been
travelin' with is either dead or a cripple.
Sposin' you pal up with me. Tell me yer
will, kid, and we'll hop it together, now."</p>

<p>"How about the rest of the gang?"</p>

<p>"What about 'em. I ain't a regular--just
horned in on this deal to make a coupla
grand extra."</p>

<p>"But I'm expensive--" she laughed.</p>

<p>"I'll say you are! What of it? I make
good money. I'm no lousy crook. I've
got a real profession."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I'm a wrestler, kid, and I ain't no slouch
at it, either."</p>

<p>For a moment Dorothy paled. For some
reason she seemed taken aback.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>Dorothy straightened her lithe figure.</p>

<p>"Not a thing," she shrugged. Then
musingly, "So you're a wrestler, eh?"</p>

<p>"Sure--what did yer think I was--a gigolo?"</p>

<p>Dorothy giggled. "Know this hold?"
she asked casually.</p>

<p>And then a startling thing occurred--especially
startling to the unsuspecting
Mike. There was a flash of brown-sweatered
arms, a swirl of darker brown
hair and Mike felt himself gripped by one
elbow and the side of his neck. He knew
the hold, had practiced it in gymnasium,
but not for some years. To be seized violently
thus aroused the man and it brought
an instinctive muscular reaction which was
assisted by a stab of pain as Dorothy's
thumb sank upon the nerve which is called
the "funny bone."</p>

<p>Yes, Mike knew the hold, and how to
break it and recover; so as Dorothy swirled
him backward onto the table with uncanny
strength, he pivoted. Then, clutching her
under her arms, he clasped his hands just
beneath her shoulder blades, bearing
downward with his head against her chest.
It was a back-breaking grip, but her slender
form twisted in his arms as though he
had been trying to hold a revolving shaft.
An arm slipped over his shoulder, a hand
fastened on his wrist and began to tug it
slowly upward with the deliberate strength
of a low-geared safe hoist. Then the other
hand, stealing around him, encircled the
middle finger of his clasped hand and began
to force it back--a jiu jitsu trick. If
he resisted, the finger would be broken.
To release his clasp would mean a probable
dislocation of the other arm.</p>

<p>Mike realized that he had to do not only
with a phenomenally strong girl, but with
a skilled and practiced exponent of Oriental
wrestling tricks. He was by no means
ignorant of this school, and countered the
attack in the proper technical way--with
utter relaxation for the moment--a supple
yielding, followed by a swift offensive.
Though he was broader of shoulder and
heavier, the two were nearly of equal
height, possibly of equal strength, but of
a different sort. Mike's was slower, but
enduring; Dorothy's more that of the
panther--swift, high of innervation, but
incapable of sustained tension.</p>

<p>Such maneuvers as immediately followed
in this curious combat were startling.
Mike felt that he was struggling
with an opponent far more skilled than
himself in jiu jitsu, one trained to the last
degree in the scientific application of the
levers and fulcrums by which minimum
force might achieve maximum results in
the straining of ligaments and paralysis of
muscles.</p>

<p>And to give him his due, for all his bluff
about striking her with the gun on the way
up to the house, Mike had some decent instincts
beneath his roughness. Whereas
he was striving to overcome without permanently
injuring the girl, Dorothy had
no such qualms. She was fighting with
deliberate intention of putting him out of
the running, for at least such time as would
permit her to carry out her plans for
escape.</p>

<p>But for a time Mike's efforts were purely
defensive, his object to save himself from
disgraceful defeat. What would the gang
say if she bested him, a professional wrestler,
and make her getaway?</p>

<p>They fell across the table, shattering the
crockery, then pitched off on to the floor
with Mike underneath.</p>

<p>He writhed over on his face and offered
an opening for an elbow twist which was
not neglected. There was an instant when
he thought the joint would go; but he broke
the hold by a headspin at the cost of infinite
pain.</p>

<p>Mike had seen the state in which jiu
jitsu wrestlers left their vanquished adversaries.
Defeat at this girl's hands would
probably leave him helpless and crippled
for three or four hours. It was not a pleasant
thought. He would have to hurt her--hurt
her badly, if he could.</p>

<p>He was flat on his face again when suddenly
he felt his automatic jerked from
its holster and she sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"If you move an eyelash," said Dorothy,
rather breathlessly, "I'll pull the trigger!"</p>

<p>"If you don't drop that rod at once, I'll
blow the top of your head off," declared a
dispassionate voice from the doorway.</p>

<p>Dorothy dropped the gun.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch14' class='c007'><i>Chapter XIV</i><br />Â <br />THE DOCTOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"And now, Mike," continued the voice,
"I'd like to know how you happened to be
caught napping."</p>

<p>Dorothy swung round to see a young
woman standing in the doorway. With a
gasp of consternation she found herself
staring down the barrel of a revolver. For
a fraction of a second her heart turned over
with a sickening thud. Then she recovered
her poise.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess <i>my</i> trick's over," she exclaimed
as cheerfully as possible.</p>

<p>Mike scrambled to his feet, catching up
his automatic as he did so. Instead of answering
the girl who leaned against the
door frame, he stared at Dorothy in a sort
of amazed wonder. She met his gaze, a
malicious little smile at the corners of her
mouth. Aside from a flush on her cheeks,
she showed not the slightest sign of the ordeal
she had just passed through, nor the
exhaustion it must have produced. His
eyes fell rather stupidly to her feet. If Mike
had not so recently staggered under
Dorothy's material weight, he would not
have believed her to possess any at all. He
drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Who taught you jiu jitsu?"</p>

<p>"A woman professional in New York.
She had a class--the others went in for it
in a lady like way. But I took it up seriously
because I thought I might need it
some day."</p>

<p>"Have you--ever?" He had dropped his
east side argot, she noticed.</p>

<p>"Once or twice--but never like this,"
she smiled.</p>

<p>"I should hope not." Mike was rather
pale. He frowned. "Where do you get
your appalling strength?"</p>

<p>"Heredity--and training. I come by it
honestly. It's not so extraordinary as some
people seem to think." Her smile widened.
"My father is the strongest man I've ever
known. Although you'd never guess it by
looking at him. He can do all sorts of
stunts. He's trained me--running, boxing,
fencing, swimming--"</p>

<p>"I'll say he has! I wouldn't have believed
it possible--and you only a kid!"</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded and looked at him with
a curious light in her gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'm not so strong as you
think--I know a little more about Oriental
wrestling than you do, that's all."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all!" said the woman by the
doorway in a mocking tone. She stepped
across the threshold and came toward
them. "Go over there and sit down." She
motioned Dorothy to a chair. "And not
another peep out of you--understand?"
Her eyes gleamed at Dorothy through narrowed
lids with a light more metallic than
the reflection from the barrel of her automatic.
It was a strange look--combined
of ruthlessness and malicious amusement.</p>

<p>"Interesting--very interesting, indeed!"</p>

<p>She turned to Mike, as Dorothy obeyed
her and sat down.</p>

<p>"And now that you and your little lady
friend have finished your heart-to-heart,
perhaps you'll tell me what it's all about--why
I find you flat on the floor covered by
her gun?"</p>

<p>"Jealous, Sadie?" Mike's tone was tantalizing.</p>

<p>"You <i>fool</i>!"</p>

<p>She took a step forward. The expression
on her face underwent a startling change.
Mockery gave way to an exasperated ferocity.
Her eyes opened to their full size.
Then the volcano of her wrath erupted.
Words poured forth with the sharp regularity
of a riveting hammer. Mike was
given a description of his characteristics,
moral, mental and physical, that brought
the angry blood to his forehead.</p>

<p>Whereupon he retorted in like spirit and
soon they were going it hammer and tongs,
while the fury on Sadie's face froze into
livid hate.</p>

<p>It was a wicked face, yet beautiful,
Dorothy thought as she watched from her
chair in the corner; a strangely beautiful
face beneath a coiled crown of glorious
red hair. But its beauty was distorted, devilish.
Her lips were scarlet, slightly
parted, showing the double rim of her even
teeth as she hurled insult after insult at the
man before her. Like some evil goddess,
she stood motionless, the rise and fall of her
bosom the only token of the deadly emotion
she felt as her even tones poured forth
vituperation.</p>

<p>Presently Dorothy's ears caught the
sound of footsteps thumping on the porch.
The lame man limped into the room and
sized up the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>"Stop that scrapping, you two!" he commanded.
"Stop it, Sadie! Do you hear
me? Stop it at once!"</p>

<p>The red-haired girl glared at him, but
she obeyed. There was a dangerous finality
in his tone that debarred argument.
She swept over to the table, and deliberately
turning her back upon the others, poured
herself a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>"Mike!" barked the Italian. "Go out
and give the others a hand. We've got a
couple of invalids with us. I've already
administered first aid, but they will have
to be carried upstairs and put to bed. Hustle,
now!"</p>

<p>Mike disappeared through the door
without a word. This little lame person
seemed to brook no opposition. He was
probably the brain and the leader of this
gang, thought Dorothy--but he was speaking
to her now.</p>

<p>"Good evening again, Miss Dixon! I
felt somehow certain we were fated to
meet a third time tonight!" His glance
snapped from her to Sadie and back again.
"Sorry we had to 'bag' you, as it were--hope
you suffered no great inconvenience?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right," she replied coolly.</p>

<p>"But I notice that your sweater is torn in
several places. You will excuse me?--but
you look rather rumpled. I got the impression
that you and the young lady who is at
present drinking coffee might have had--a
difference of opinion, shall we say?"</p>

<p>"No. These tears in my sweater were
caused by accident. Miss Martinelli had
nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>"So you know her name! But, of course
you would. That bicarbonate of soda
proved a boomerang. Too bad she really
needed it at the time. It's a lesson to us,
to remember that servant girls are likely
to be lazy."</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't Lizzie's fault," smiled
Dorothy. "I caught her before she had
had time to wash the glass, that's all."</p>

<p>"You are a very clever young woman."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about that--" she
drawled. Then she left her chair and took
a step toward him. "Tell me--is Bill Bolton
very badly hurt?"</p>

<p>"Just a bit frazzled, that's all." Her
aviation instructor limped into the room.
His coat was gone and his soft shirt, once
white, hung from his shoulders in dirty,
tattered streamers. One eye, half-closed,
was rapidly turning black. Blood streaked
his cheeks. Just above his left knee the
trouser-leg had been cut away and a blood-soaked
bandage was visible. Dorothy saw
that his wrists were handcuffed behind his
back. At his elbow, a man whose jaw was
queerly twisted to one side, stood guard
with drawn revolver.</p>

<p>The lame man grinned. "Here's your
young friend now. You can take him in
the kitchen if you like and wash him off a
bit. I'll come in later with some bandages.
You'll find matches and a lamp on a shelf
just inside the door.--Stick that gun in
your pocket, Tony," he added to his henchman.
"Come over here. Now that we've
proper light, I'll snap that jaw of yours
back into place."</p>

<p>Dorothy put an arm about Bill without
speaking and led him slowly into the dark
room. Then as her hand groped for
matches on the shelf, there came a loud
click from the other room, followed by a
scream of anguish. Dorothy felt her hair
rise on the back of her neck. There was
a momentary silence, then low, breathless
moans.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bill?" she whispered fearfully.
"What's happened?"</p>

<p>Bill chuckled. "Tony's dislocated jaw is
back in place, now, that's all. Too bad I
didn't knock it clean off while I was about
it. He's the bird who knifed me a while
ago. No fault of his that he only got me
in the leg, either. I'm glad to hear he's getting
his, now."</p>

<p>"Goodness--" Dorothy found the
matches at last and struck one. "Here I
stand--and you're badly hurt--don't say
you aren't--I know it. Where's that lamp?
He said it was on the shelf. It isn't. There
it is on the table. <i>Dash</i>--there goes the
match!"</p>

<p>"Take it easy, kid!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right. That man's scream
kind of set my teeth on edge."</p>

<p>She struck another match, then lit the
lamp and carried it to a dresser by the sink.</p>

<p>"Come over here and sit down," she
said, drawing out a chair. "I want to swab
out that cut in your leg. The rag is
filthy--" She pulled out the drawer in the
dresser. "Here's luck! Towels--clean
ones! Who'd have thought it!"</p>

<p>With deft fingers she unfastened his
bandage, then cleaned the wound with
fresh water from the pump, using every
precaution not to hurt him.</p>

<p>"You're certainly good at this kind of
thing," was Bill's sincere tribute as she
turned her attention to the bruised cut on
his head.</p>

<p>"Part of my high school course, you
know. I'm better at this than at Latin," she
admitted with a smile. "Tell me what happened
in the woods after I got scragged
and Mike carted me up here?"</p>

<p>"Who's Mike?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about him in a minute. Get
along with your story first."</p>

<p>"Not much of a story. I didn't last long
enough to make it interesting."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well--I heard you yell and half turned
when Tony and another lad jumped me.
You know what happened to Tony--"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the shot right afterward? Oh,
Bill, I was scared silly they'd killed you!
Whose gun <i>was</i> that?"</p>

<p>"Mine. I'd got my gat loose by that
time and drilled him through the shoulder.
It turned out later that he tripped over a
log when he fell, came down with his leg
under him and snapped the bone. When
I learned the horrid truth, I wept!"</p>

<p>"I'll bet you did! Couldn't you break
away then?"</p>

<p>"I could not. Several others had joined
the rough-house by that time. For a while--not
very long--we played a lively little
game of tag, blind-man's-buff, postoffice,
dilly-dilly-come-and-be-killed, with me as
dilly, until another chap jumped out of a
Ford on to the middle of my back and
rubbed my face in the cool, wet soil! At
that bright moment old Limpy clinched
these handcuffs on my wrists and read me
a lecture on the error of my ways.</p>

<p>"He's a physician when he isn't bank-robbing,
I think. Anyway, the gang call
him 'Doctor.' He seems to be running
the show. Not such a bad lad if he could
be made over again. Tony, you must
know, has developed an almost uncontrollable
penchant for sheathing his pigsticker
in my carcass once more. Strangely
enough, I can't see it Tony's way. And
fortunately for me, neither can the Doctor!
Now, young lady, if you're finished
squeezing cold water into my sore eye, I'll
sing the doxology!"</p>

<p>Dorothy giggled. "Aren't you funny!
I don't believe more than half of that tale
is true. I'll wager things were a whole lot
worse than you've painted them, sir!"</p>

<p>"Well, you've proved to be a good little
guesser quite often--what I'm interested
in is what happened to you."</p>

<p>Dorothy told him.</p>

<p>"Nice work!" Bill complimented her
as she finished talking. "I know a few jiu
jitsu holds, but you must be a wonder at it.
It's too bad Staten Island Sadie had to butt
in and spoil your show. The more I see of
that lady, the less I like her. She was in the
woods when the gang jumped us--barged
off in a huff later, because the Doc
wouldn't let her croak me then and there.
She's a nice little playmate. Every one of
this gang is a cold-blooded thug--but she's
a fiend! But, to tell the honest truth, it's
our lame friend who worries me most."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Dorothy. "That suave
manner of his gives me the creeps!"</p>

<p>"So sorry--" purred the Doctor's voice
directly behind them. "But if I were in
your position, my young friends, I should
undoubtedly be worried, too."</p>

<p>Bill and Dorothy swung round to see
him coming toward them. In his hand he
carried a small, black bag.</p>

<p>"How is our invalid, nurse?" he inquired,
feigning ignorance of their startled
surprise, and placing his satchel on the
table. "Those who live by the sword--but
you are familiar with the quotation, I'm
sure?"</p>

<p>Opening the bag, he produced bandages,
adhesive tape, a pair of surgical scissors
and a large tube of salve.</p>

<p>"Lay these out, so I can reach them
easily, please," he ordered as he unwrapped
the temporary bandage Dorothy had
bound about Bill's leg.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see you have cleansed the
wound, but it is safer to be more thorough.
Hand me one of the swabs you will find
wrapped in cellophane in the bag, please.
Strange how the professional spirit will
dominate--even though the patient's life
may not be a long one!" He glanced smilingly
at Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me the knife was poisoned?"
she cried in horror.</p>

<p>"Hardly anything so melodramatic, my
dear. You don't quite grasp my meaning."</p>

<p>"He means," said Bill grimly, "that after
he has had the fun of patching me up, I'm
to be taken for a ride. But don't let him
bluff you. He's only trying to scare us."</p>

<p>"Too much knowledge is dangerous at
times--entirely too dangerous," returned
the lame man. "Hand me another swab,
nurse. But you put it rather crudely,
young man--and I am perfectly in earnest,
I assure you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you couldn't do <i>that</i>!" Dorothy
blenched and her hand shook as she passed
him the swab.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it is not entirely up to
me," he replied, carefully cleaning the
wound. "The matter of your friend's
future, shall I say?--as well as your own,
will have to be put to vote presently. Of
course, if Miss Martinelli has her way--but
why anticipate the unpleasant?"</p>

<p>To Dorothy's surprise, Bill chuckled.</p>

<p>"They hang in this state, for murder,"
he remarked coolly. "It's a nasty death,
I've heard. What's more, Doctor, a man
of your mentality does not deliberately
stick his head into a noose!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, my young friend. But
you forget that in order to prove murder,
there must be a body--or bodies, as the
case may be." The Doctor looked up at
Bill and smiled again.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch15' class='c007'><i>Chapter XV</i><br />Â <br />STATEN ISLAND SADIE HAS HER WAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"I believe that I have done all that is
necessary," said the Doctor after a few
minutes--"and I think the patient will
be more comfortable now." Then, with
a sardonic gleam in his eye, he added,
"Also, I have enjoyed our conversation
very much!"</p>

<p>He walked to the sink where he washed
his hands and dried them carefully on a
clean towel.</p>

<p>"And so, if you young people are quite
ready, we'll adjourn for that voting contest
I mentioned a little while ago."</p>

<p>He motioned them to precede him, and
brought up the rear with his bag as
Dorothy helped Bill limp into the front
room.</p>

<p>Politely, the Doctor placed chairs for
them and bade them be seated. Never once
had this black-eyed little man's manner
betokened anything but courteous consideration.
But his suavity troubled Dorothy
far more than bluster would have done.
She sensed the venom behind his smooth
tones, the purring growl of the tiger before
it springs.</p>

<p>Dorothy knew she was losing her nerve.
But she looked at Bill and smiled bravely
as they sat down.</p>

<p>Bill smiled back at her then shifted his
glance with hers to the table, where the
members of the gang were seated. The
little Doctor headed the board, the others
at the side facing the room. Next to the
lame man sat the red-haired girl; then
came Mike, Tony, who was nursing his
jaw, Johnny, the man who had fetched the
wheelbarrow, and another whom Dorothy
had not seen before. Tony, she fancied,
had played the part of chauffeur at the
bank.</p>

<p>Then Bill broke into the low-voiced conversation
that was going on at the table.</p>

<p>"How about unlocking these handcuffs,
Doctor?"</p>

<p>The Doctor shook his head. "No, no,
my young friend. Even with your honorable
wounds of combat, you are far too
active for us to take any chances."</p>

<p>"But what could I do? You are six to
one, counting Miss Martinelli--and all
armed," insisted Bill. "These things are
darned uncomfortable."</p>

<p>Tony shot him a deadly glance. "I'm
glad to hear it," he muttered through
clenched teeth. "You'll be a lot more uncomfortable
by the time I finish with you."</p>

<p>"Shut up, you two!" snapped Sadie.
"Now, Dad," she went on in a different
tone, addressing the Doctor, "let's finish
this business. We can't sit here gabbing
all night."</p>

<p>"That's what I say!" This from Johnny.
"Bump off the pair of 'em--they know too
much. Then we can divvy up and be on
our way!"</p>

<p>"You forget that it is our custom to put
such matters to vote," interposed the Doctor.
"Two of our company are upstairs
and unable to attend. Also, another member
is expected at any time now. Without
his help our little <i>coup</i> would have been
extremely difficult."</p>

<p>"Chuck and Pete are too ill to vote,"
argued Miss Martinelli. "As for Perkins--that
sap is scared to death! I doubt
if he shows up at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, he wants his share," declared the
Doctor. "He'll come. We shall give him
five minutes--and then continue our business."</p>

<p>He tapped a cigarette on the back of his
gold case, struck a match and lounged
back in his chair, inhaling the aromatic
smoke with evident enjoyment.</p>

<p>Dorothy's eyes met Bill's in astonishment.</p>

<p>He smiled but said nothing.</p>

<p>It was interesting enough that Sadie
should turn out to be the Doctor's daughter.
But the news that Harry Perkins, her
father's trusted lieutenant at the bank, was
mixed up in this robbery was simply dumfounding
to Dorothy. That was how
things had been made easy for the gang--that
was how they knew just when Mrs.
Hamberfield's necklace would be in her
deposit box. And another thing--Perkins'
home was on the Marvin Ridge Road,
just beyond the Mayo place where the Pen
and Pencil Club were to meet! The Doctor
had been coming from the Perkins'
house when she and Billy had met his car.
And that explained the absence of road oil
on the Packard's tires!</p>

<p>Johnny's voice interrupted her train of
thought.</p>

<p>"How are we goin' to make our getaway
tonight with them two lads down and out
upstairs?" he grumbled. "Our plan was
to separate after we'd divvied up the loot--but
them fellers can't be moved."</p>

<p>"Supposing you stay and look after
them--" derided Sadie. "When we've
made the divvy, as you call it, this bunch
breaks up for the time being. We all go
our own sweet ways. It's a case of each
for himself. If you want to stick here and
nurse those boobs upstairs, nobody's going
to stop you."</p>

<p>"Not me! I don't know nothin' about--"</p>

<p>"Then keep your mouth shut. Whatever
we do, we'll decide later on. How
about the time, Dad?"</p>

<p>"Time's up," decided the Doctor with a
glance at his watch. "We'll wait no longer
for Mr. Perkins. Now, concerning our
two young friends who were so unwise as
to join us tonight--what is your pleasure?"</p>

<p>"Bump them off, of course, as Johnny
so prettily puts it," yawned Sadie languidly.
"I'll attend to the job, if the rest
of you are squeamish."</p>

<p>"We will put it to vote," announced the
Doctor. "Those in favor will raise their
right hands and say 'aye'."</p>

<p>Five hands, including his own, sprang
into the air.</p>

<p>"Contraries, 'no'."</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>," said Mike in a firm voice, holding
up his right hand.</p>

<p>"The ayes have it," declared the Doctor
dispassionately.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Mike?"
sneered Sadie. "Got a crush on the girl?"</p>

<p>"No," retorted Mike. "Just trying to
stop you from making an even bigger fool
of yourself than you are usually!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to pipe down,
Mike." The Doctor's eyes gleamed balefully.
"Sentence has been passed on Miss
Dixon and Mr. Bolton--and that is all
there is to it."</p>

<p>"That's where you're dead wrong."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Don't you realize
that these two know too much about us to
permit them to live?"</p>

<p>"Have I said they didn't? But Sadie
should not be allowed to be their executioner."</p>

<p>"Oh--aren't you considerate!" Sadie's
tone was pregnant with sarcasm. "Want
the job yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly--none of us should
do it."</p>

<p>"Who then, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Why, Perkins, of course."</p>

<p>"You're crazy! He hasn't the nerve."</p>

<p>"Maybe not--make him do it anyway."</p>

<p>It was the lame man's turn to take a
hand. "And why should Mr. Harry Perkins
be so entrusted?"</p>

<p>"To keep his mouth shut."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"And I didn't think you could be so
dense. Look here, Doctor. I haven't been
one of your crowd long, but I'd never have
joined up at all if I'd known I was getting
in with such a bunch of nitwits!"</p>

<p>"You are forgetting yourself, I think,"
the Doctor's tone was cutting.</p>

<p>"No. I ain't. Listen--Perkins only
came into this because he was up against it
proper. How you found out he had speculated,
first with his own money and then
with the bank's, is none of my affair. What
I do know is that when Wall Street put
him into a tight place, you put up the extra
margin with his brokers upon an assurance
from him that he would do--just what
he's done!"</p>

<p>"You are very well informed, Mike.
And what then?"</p>

<p>"Just this: the bank has been robbed, but
it was a crude job at best. Why the bulls
haven't fastened on Perkins already on account
of that time-lock business, is beyond
me. Then, for once in your long and successful
career, you were careless, Doctor.
You allowed your paternal feeling to out-weigh
your natural caution. The result is
that the cops got Sadie's fingerprints and
a description of you, of her and of Tony.
I am simply bringing all this up to show
you that we are not out of the mess yet--not
by a long shot."</p>

<p>"In other words, you think we have a
fifty-fifty chance with the police?"</p>

<p>"Better than that, perhaps. I think,
though, that if we do get nailed, we should
stop Perkins from blabbing--and stop
him effectually."</p>

<p>"I see," said Sadie. "Let him bump off
the pair over there--then take him for a
ride?"</p>

<p>"Be still, carissima!" Doctor Martinelli
was interested. "I see what Mike is driving
at. He fears that if things should by
chance go wrongly, Harry Perkins would
try to save his precious skin by turning
state's evidence. And that if he were
forced to--er--place these two young people
where they will do the least harm, Mr.
Perkins will not be in a position himself
to turn state's evidence--that is, of course,
should it become necessary. That is your
reason for not voting with the rest of us?"</p>

<p>"It is, Doctor. Do you wish to vote on
it again?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. I consider your plan
adequate."</p>

<p>"But why make the biggest mistake--of
murdering us?" Bill entered the conversation.</p>

<p>Dorothy leaned toward him. "It's no
use, Bill," she whispered steadily.
"They've made up their minds--and you
heard what the Doctor said in the other
room!"</p>

<p>Bill did not attempt to reply, for Doctor
Martinelli was speaking again.</p>

<p>"And why, in your opinion, are we making
a mistake in putting you and Miss
Dixon out of the running?" he inquired affably.
"Take your time, young man, answer
carefully. We are in no hurry--until
Mr. Harry Perkins arrives."</p>

<p>"He won't arrive," rejoined Bill. "The
authorities have got him by this time."</p>

<p>"Bluff!" shot out Sadie and turned
fiercely on her father. "What's the use of
all this?" she cried. "It makes me sick.
Why do you stand for it?"</p>

<p>"Because he knows Bill <i>isn't</i> bluffing!"
Dorothy's raised voice silenced the
woman. "We knew that you had been visiting
Harry Perkins this evening, Doctor.
And we passed word to the police on our
way through New Canaan. The only reason
you weren't arrested on the way up is
because they want to catch the whole gang
together. If you hadn't shown up here,
the rest of your people might have got wise
and left before the police could make arrangements
to surround the place."</p>

<p>"But, you see, my dear," said the Doctor,
"I wasn't visiting Mr. Perkins this evening.
I had just motored up from the Post
Road, and--ah--points east, when I ran
into you and your friend Bill."</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed. "Oh, no, you hadn't,
Doctor. The road beyond Perkins' place
was freshly oiled. There was no sign of
oil on your car."</p>

<p>"She got you that time, Doc!" exclaimed
Mike. "D'you mind saying why you were
foolish enough to drop in on Perkins and
put us up a tree this way?"</p>

<p>Doctor Martinelli was irritated. "Because
the safest place to park that loot was
in Perkins' house," he snapped, "and as
he refused to bring it up here himself, I had
to fetch it."</p>

<p>"Then all I can say is that you and Sadie
have made a pretty mess of things."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" retorted the red-haired
young woman. "Was it <i>my</i> fault that that
fellow over there landed his plane on the
lake? That was before the New Canaan
deal. He had nothing at all to go on
then!"</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong," broke in
Bill. "Your hair and those beach pajamas
make a combination not easily forgotten.
You wore them once too often, Miss Martinelli."</p>

<p>"And you seem to forget," added
Dorothy, "that you've been finger-printed
both in this country and in England. The
police know all about you and your father
and Tony. They probably have the records
of the rest of your gang. If anything
happens to Bill or myself, you are
bound to pay the penalty."</p>

<p>"Say, Doc!" Johnny's excited voice
sounded shrilly, "I don't like this--not a
little bit I don't. Tie up that pair and let's
vamoose. Them cops is likely to be here
any minute. I'm tired of all this fool talk.
Come on--this place is gettin' too hot fer
me!"</p>

<p>Mike got to his feet. "I don't stir from
this place until I get my share of the divvy,"
he declared firmly. "What's the matter
with you, Johnny? If Doc lights out
with the bag full of kale, it ain't likely
the rest of us will ever get what's coming
to us."</p>

<p>"But I can't afford to get pinched--"
Johnny faltered. "Not after that Jersey
City job, I can't. It means the hot seat for
me." The gangster shivered and moistened
his lips.</p>

<p>"It is my candid opinion that you are all
exciting yourselves unnecessarily." The
Doctor's voice betrayed no emotion whatsoever.
"Miss Dixon and Mr. Bolton are
clever young people--but not quite clever
enough. They're throwing a gigantic
bluff to save their lives. The police won't
be here tonight. Why? Simply because if
they knew anything about this house, we
would have been raided long before this.
Those two haven't told the police or anyone
else a thing about it. They wanted
to pull off their job all by themselves!"</p>

<p>"And how, may I ask, do you figure
that?" Bill endeavored to make his tone
sarcastic.</p>

<p>"For this reason: if you had reported
what you had learned--and guessed--the
authorities would never have permitted
you to come here tonight. And this proves
it!"</p>

<p>There was a light step on the porch and
Harry Perkins came in through the open
door.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch16' class='c007'><i>Chapter XVI</i><br />Â <br />WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WINE CELLAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"Sorry to be so late," greeted the bank's
cashier. "My car broke down. I've had
to walk five miles, at least--" He broke
off, catching sight of Dorothy and Bill for
the first time.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he exclaimed, "what are you
two doing here?"</p>

<p>"They are waiting for you to bump them
off," replied Sadie with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" Perkins
gazed breathlessly around the room.</p>

<p>"Just what I said. You are going to stop
their mouths for good--and do it right
now. We've been shilly-shallying over
this business long enough!"</p>

<p>Perkins' glance took in the others seated
at the table.</p>

<p>"Has she gone nuts?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We have decided that you are to do
what my daughter has just mentioned,"
said the Doctor smoothly.</p>

<p>"And I," retorted Perkins angrily, "tell
you here and now that I will be no party
to murder!"</p>

<p>Sadie drew her revolver.</p>

<p>"Well--if he won't, I will!" she began
when her wrist was caught in a grip of steel,
then twisted up and backward.</p>

<p>"Drop it, little one--drop it--or I'll
break your arm," said Mike.</p>

<p>Sadie shrieked with pain, but she dropt
her revolver and Mike pocketed it.</p>

<p>"I'll get you for that!" she screamed.</p>

<p>Her father leaned forward in his chair.
"Shut up, you idiot!" he said coldly and
deliberately slapped her across the mouth
with his open hand. "We've had enough
from you for one evening. Mike was perfectly
right to stop you. Perkins is going
to do this job, and you know <i>why</i> he is
going to do it. I'll have no more argument
from you. Keep still now, until you
have my permission to speak."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I'll have nothing to do
with it," repeated Perkins, and attempted
to light with trembling fingers the half-burned
cigar he was chewing.</p>

<p>Doctor Martinelli swung round in his
chair. "You'll do as you're told," he said
through clenched teeth. "A little persuasion
of the kind I have in mind has been
known to make braver men than you
change their opinions, Mr. Harry Perkins!"
He glared at the cashier, who
dropped his eyes--and the cigar--at one
and the same moment.</p>

<p>"That's the way, Doc," applauded Mike,
getting to his feet. "We've been sittin'
round this table so long we're all getting
stale. What we need's a little excitement."</p>

<p>He pointed to Dorothy and Bill.</p>

<p>"I'll take these two down stairs and stick
them in the old wine cellar. They'll keep
fine and dandy down there. Later, when
Mr. Perkins sees reason he can run down
and finish them off. While I'm gone,
Johnny, you beat it out to the woodshed
and fetch in a length of garden hose." He
guffawed--"I guess you know that trick--the
bulls have made it pretty popular?"</p>

<p>The lame man smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"O.K. Doc?"</p>

<p>"It's a good plan, Mike. Go ahead with
it."</p>

<p>Mike took a flashlight from his pocket
and beckoned to the prisoners.</p>

<p>Sadie pushed back her chair and jumped
up. "Tie that girl or she'll get away!" she
ordered.</p>

<p>"Pipe down!" thundered the gangster
and there was an ugly gleam in his eyes as
he glared at her. "Give me any more of
your lip, Sadie, and you'll take a trip downstairs
yourself. Some day when you ain't
got a thing to do fer a couple of weeks, try
gettin' outa that place with the door locked.
Run along now--murder yourself, if you
have to--you red-headed bag of hot wind!"</p>

<p>He turned his back on the furious
woman and motioned Bill and Dorothy
to walk before him into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the nerve--" Dorothy heard
Sadie cry sharply as Harry Perkins broke
in with--"Look here, Doctor Martinelli,
do you really mean to--"</p>

<p>Mike shut the door, cutting the argument
in the front room to a mere mumble
of voices.</p>

<p>"Down those stairs to the right and then
straight ahead, you two," he directed,
pointing the way with his flashlight--"No
tricks, either, unless you want your buddie
hurt worse than he is now, Miss Wildcat!"</p>

<p>Dorothy, with her arm about Bill's
shoulders, stopped at the head of the cellar
stairs.</p>

<p>"I think you told me you were getting
two thousand dollars for your share in the
New Canaan robbery," she murmured.</p>

<p>"That's right--a coupla grand," he acknowledged.
"Not much, but when I
made the deal, I wasn't as strong with Doc
as I am now."</p>

<p>"If you let us go, my father will pay you
ten thousand!"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing!"</p>

<p>"And I promise you he'll use his influence
in your behalf, as well. It seems to me
a mighty easy way to make a lot of
money--"</p>

<p>Mike shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is," he admitted. "But then
you see, I've never double-crossed a pal yet,
and I'm not going to start at this late day.
Cut the chatter now--there's nothing doing."</p>

<p>"You won't regret it, Mike."</p>

<p>The door behind them opened slowly,
revealing Doctor Martinelli's slight figure.</p>

<p>"My judgment of human nature is
rarely at fault," the little man went on
rather pompously. "I believed I could
trust you--now I know it. There's a full
share coming to you on this deal, Mike.
Cut along now, but hurry back. As soon
as you've locked them up, I'll need your
help with Perkins."</p>

<p>The door closed once more and Mike
waved toward the gaping black of the
cellar stairs.</p>

<p>"You heard what Doc said--down you
go!"</p>

<p>"Over there to the left," he directed
when his two prisoners reached the bottom
and Dorothy helped Billy to hobble across
the damp, earthern floor, in the shifting
rays of Mike's torch.</p>

<p>Ahead in the wall of native stone that
formed the foundation of the house, they
could see a door of heavy wood, at least six
inches thick. Mike pushed it fully open.
For a moment Dorothy thought of jumping
him, but now she saw he carried a revolver
in his free hand.</p>

<p>"In you go!" he said roughly, elbowing
them over the threshold. But instead
of locking them in, he stepped over the
sill and gently pulled the door shut behind
him.</p>

<p>Bill, anticipating the end, stepped between
Dorothy and their captor.</p>

<p>"Let her go, Mike. Her father and
mine will give you anything you ask.
Shoot me if you must--but let her go.
Use two shots, and the others will think--tell
them--"</p>

<p>"Quiet, please," whispered Mike
fiercely, and Dorothy started, for he spoke
now with the voice of a well bred Englishman.</p>

<p>"Neither of you will be shot tonight, if
you do as I tell you. Here--take this automatic,
Miss Dixon. And listen carefully,
both of you. I've only a minute. You'll
find a few useful articles under the pile of
sacking in that far corner," he went on,
pointing into the gloom behind them.
"Then, get out of the window as quickly
as you can--the bars are sawn through.
Your car is still parked where you left it.
Go straight home. That, I think, will be
all at present."</p>

<p>Bill and Dorothy stared at him in wide-eyed
amazement.</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway?" the girl whispered,
peering up at him.</p>

<p>"To ease your minds," he smiled, "I'm
not exactly what I pretend to be. And I
want to apologize to you, Miss Dixon, for
the exceedingly crude game I was forced
to play with you. The Doctor had his suspicions
of me, until just a few moments
ago, I believe, and he has had us watched
ever since I brought you here. But now
he has proved his judgment to be sound--"
he chuckled to himself--"and has ceased
his strict surveillance."</p>

<p>He paused a moment then went on,
more seriously. "My name is Michael
Conway. I am a detective-inspector in the
Criminal Investigation Department of
New Scotland Yard. I've trailed certain
members of the Martinelli gang all the
way from London. My plans seem to
have miscarried this evening; otherwise,
you need not have been put to all this inconvenience.
Remember that the house
has ears, and be as quiet as possible. Good
night--and good luck!"</p>

<p>The door swung shut behind him. They
heard him turn the key in the lock and he
was gone.</p>

<p>"Gee Whiz!" muttered Bill, "and I
thought--"</p>

<p>"Sh--Bill!" cautioned Dorothy. "Never
mind now. Stand where you are, or you'll
break your neck in this darkness."</p>

<p>Her voice came from farther off now.
He knew she was feeling her way across
the room toward the corner.</p>

<p>Presently a light appeared and she spoke
again.</p>

<p>"I've found the things," she told Bill.
"Besides this flash, there's another automatic,
a small ax, and a chisel."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven for that," said Bill.
"Now I've a chance of getting these handcuffs
off!"</p>

<p>"But we can't do it in here," Dorothy
objected. "Remember what Mike said
about making a noise. We'll have to wait
till we get outside. There's the window.
It's going to be a tight squeeze."</p>

<p>Her light showed them they were standing
in a narrow room, walled like the
cellar in native stone. Along the sides,
piled one on top of the other were wine
casks, which proved to be empty. The
damp air was heavy with the fumes of
evaporating lees. High to one side was
a small barred window.</p>

<p>"Lean against this barrel, so it won't
slip," whispered Dorothy, and clambered
up to the window. "Yes, the bars are
loose!"</p>

<p>She removed the short lengths of rusty
iron from the open frame and carefully
laid them on the ground outside.</p>

<p>"Now the paraphernalia--" She placed
ax, chisel and revolver beside the bars on
the grass and descended to Bill's side.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll have to go first," observed
Bill. "We'll never make it, otherwise.
Give me a boost, will you?"</p>

<p>They were both breathless and nearly
exhausted by the time Bill had been
pushed up and out of the window. Dorothy
was so tired it took every ounce of
her waning strength to drag herself
through the narrow aperture after him.
They rested for some minutes in the long,
dewy grass, gathering strength and courage
for the waiting ordeal.</p>

<p>As soon as they began to move away
from the house, Dorothy realized that Bill
was near collapse. Even with her supporting
arm, he lurched and stumbled
through the tangled undergrowth.</p>

<p>"It's that old hole in my leg," he
grumbled in answer to her question. "It's
opened up again--been bleeding pretty
freely. You'd better leave me here."</p>

<p>He sank wearily to the ground behind
a cluster of elder bushes, about two hundred
yards from the house, the weight of
his body pulling Dorothy to her knees beside
him.</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the kind!" she whispered
fiercely.</p>

<p>"But you must--I can't go any further,"
his voice trailed off weakly.</p>

<p>With a quick movement she felt for his
wound in the darkness and tightened the
bandage.</p>

<p>"We'll wait here till you're strong
enough to walk, that's all. If I try to run
the car up here, they'll hear it from the
house. There's no use to try to cut off
your handcuffs, either. The least sound
will bring that gang down on us."</p>

<p>"Not the car--" he mumbled. "The amphibian--beat
it for the Loening--and
bring help."</p>

<p>Dorothy bit her lip. With Bill delirious
there was nothing she could do but remain
with him.</p>

<p>"That's all right," she said, trying to
calm him--"We'll stay here till you feel
stronger, Bill. Then I'll help you down
to the car."</p>

<p>Bill had been lying on his side, his head
pillowed on her knees. Now he wriggled
into a sitting position.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty well all in," he admitted,
"but I'm not off my head--not yet--if
that's what you're thinking.--Didn't I tell
you about the amphibian?"</p>

<p>"You certainly did not----" Dorothy's
tone was relieved, yet excited.</p>

<p>"Well, here's the dope, then. She's
parked in the next valley--over that hill
behind the house. You'll find her under
the trees at the edge of a wood lot. I flew
up here several nights ago. Wanted a
means of quick getaway, if it became necessary.
Frank met me over there and
drove me home. It's a rotten landing place.
You'll find it worse for the take off. You'll
be taking an awful chance to do it."</p>

<p>Dorothy got to her feet. "You certainly
are the one and only life-saver," she
breathed joyfully. "Every time we get
really up against it--you've a plane up
your sleeve or something. Don't worry--I'll
fly it all right!"</p>

<p>"Hop it for Danbury, then. When you
get there, land in the fair grounds. Phone
the police and tell them to run down in a
car and that you'll fly them back here. You
can land on the lake. The bus has a searchlight--"</p>

<p>He broke off as the sharp detonation of
an automatic came from the direction of
the house. This was followed by shouts
and the sound of a scuffle. Presently all
was quiet once more.</p>

<p>"Something's up!" said Dorothy.</p>

<p>Bill nodded gravely. "I wonder if they
haven't found we're not in the wine
cellar--if they've charged Mike Conway
with our escape?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going over to see."</p>

<p>"No, you're not--I'll go."</p>

<p>But by the time Bill had struggled to
his feet, Dorothy had run to the house and
was peering between the shutters of the
side window. She stood there for a moment,
then ran back to him.</p>

<p>"The Doctor has been shot," she gasped.
"Not badly hurt, I think--evidently took
it in the shoulder. But they've got Mike.
He's tied hand and foot and bound to a
chair!"</p>

<p>"That's bad," said Bill slowly.</p>

<p>"It's awful! They'll surely shoot him
before I can get the police here!"</p>

<p>Bill hobbled back toward the shelter of
the bushes with Dorothy's arm about his
waist.</p>

<p>"Some break!" he said disgustedly, as
he sank to the ground. "I'm out of the
running and you can't hold up that bunch
single handed--"</p>

<p>"I can try it though, Bill."</p>

<p>"Not if I have anything to say, you
won't. There are too many of 'em--it's
impossible. But what we're going to do
now, I haven't the slightest idea!"</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch17' class='c007'><i>Chapter XVII</i><br />Â <br />THE LOENING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>"One thing is clear--" said Dorothy
firmly--"and that is, we can't let Michael
Conway be butchered by that band of cut-throats.
He saved our lives--we've got
to save his."</p>

<p>Bill, his head in his hands, did not reply.</p>

<p>"If you were only in better shape so I
could get those handcuffs off--and if there
weren't so many of them in the house," she
went on, speaking her thoughts aloud,
"one of us might be able to hold them up
from the window while the other went
round through the door and took their
guns away. But we can't afford to wait till
you can walk alone and I can free your
hands. What's to become of Mr. Conway,
in the meantime? Oh, Bill, you're
generally so fertile with ideas--<i>can't</i> you
think of any thing?"</p>

<p>Bill lay motionless, and still did not
answer.</p>

<p>Dorothy stooped over him.</p>

<p>"Bill! Bill!" she called in a tense whisper.
Then, daring greatly, she flashed her
light on his face, held it there for an instant,
then snapped it off.</p>

<p>"Down and out, poor chap," was her
summing up after a glimpse of his closed
eyes and dead white features. "Loss of
blood, probably. He'll come round after
while--but when?"</p>

<p>Her heart sank. For several minutes
she knelt beside his quiet form, lost in
thought. Then she began to act.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Bill, old thing, but I've got to
leave you. It's the only way." Her murmured
tones were muffled by the sweater
she pulled over her head. Stripping free
her arms, she rolled it in a ball and placed
the soft pillow beneath Bill's head. She
gave him a little pat, then started off toward
the hill back of the house.</p>

<p>Dorothy crossed the field beyond the
farm's overgrown orchard in darkness.
It was not until she reached the woods at
the foot of the hill that she dared to snap
on her flashlight.</p>

<p>Even with its help the climb was no
sinecure. The hillside, steep as a church
roof and densely wooded, was, moreover,
thick with underbrush, which hindered
her progress. Rocky outcroppings and
huge boulders made frequent detours necessary.</p>

<p>By the time she struggled to the top she
was winded and pretty well done up. Her
vitality had suffered considerably from
strain and worry and violent exercise during
the course of the evening. She was
quite ready to drop down and have a good
cry, and to admit to herself right then that
she was beaten. Only the knowledge that
a life, possibly two, hung upon her efforts,
kept her going. Stopping only long
enough to tie a broken shoelace, she hurried
over the crest of the hill and plunged
down the farther side.</p>

<p>Here, her progress became even more
difficult, for she floundered into a berry
patch whose thorns tore her clothing and
badly scratched her face and hands. Determinedly,
she pushed her way through,
gritting her teeth in pain.</p>

<p>Presently, after several bad falls over
hidden rocks and tree stumps, she found
herself on a narrow, grass-grown wood
road at the foot of the hill. So far as she
could see, the trail wound along the middle
of the valley. But she hadn't the faintest
idea in which direction lay the field (Bill
had called it a wood lot) where the <i>Loening</i>
was hidden.</p>

<p>Dorothy was totally at a loss. <i>Why</i>
hadn't she taken more precise directions
before tramping over here? This trail
<i>must</i> lead to the wood lot or near it. Bill
said Frank had driven there in the car....</p>

<p>"What a fool I am!" she exclaimed suddenly
to the night at large and pointed
her flashlight toward the ground at her
feet.</p>

<p>There were the tire marks of a car, plain
enough. Brewster and Danbury lay far
to the left beyond the mouth of this valley
which paralleled that of the gang's headquarters.
Therefore, Bill's car must have
come up the trail from the left. The tracks
kept on up the road to her left--the wood
lot must be in that direction.</p>

<p>As she trudged on, watching carefully
for any deviation of the tire marks, she forgot
her weariness for the time being. The
winding road ended and she saw an open
space ahead. It must be the wood lot.
Hadn't Bill said it was the only possible
landing place in the valley!</p>

<p>Dorothy hurried across the field,
through a tangle of knee-high grasses and
wild flowers. She pointed her light higher
now and tried to pierce the black of the
night for a glimpse of the plane. Then she
saw it parked at the forest's edge, directly
ahead, and sprang forward with a delighted
cry.</p>

<p>As she came close, she saw that it faced
the open lot, and silently thanked Bill for
his foresight. With a plane the size of
the amphibian it would have been impossible
to swing round the tail unassisted.</p>

<p>Her preparations for this flight would
probably not have met with her instructor's
approval. But knowing that time
was more important than detail, she cut
them to a minimum.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the retractible landing
gear sufficed to satisfy her that the wheels
were securely blocked. Then she sprang
aboard and gave the engine a short ground
test. It was acting splendidly and she shut
it off almost directly.</p>

<p>A hurried trip aft to the cabin and she
came back to the pilot's cockpit, dragging
the plane's machine gun, which, after
some trouble, she managed to set up on its
tripod which she fastened to cleats in the
decking.</p>

<p>Certain now that the gun was secure,
she adjusted the ammunition belt as Bill
had instructed her. Then she raced aft
again and overside. When she returned,
she brought the wheel blocks with her.
These she dropped in the cabin, saw to it
that the door was properly fastened, then
took her place at the controls forward.</p>

<p>The night was overcast and starless; the
ceiling unusually low, and so far as she
could judge there was not the slightest
breath of wind. She switched on the
plane's searchlight and started the engine.</p>

<p>The trees at the far end of the wood lot
were uncomfortably near and high. Yet
Bill had judged a take off from such a
place to be possible, or he would never
have parked there.</p>

<p>The big Loening was moving now--rolling
drunkenly over the rough ground,
yet gaining speed with every foot. She
widened her throttle, steadily, fully--at the
same time pushing the stick well forward.
Then as the amphibian gained still more
speed and she felt the tail lift clear, she
eased the stick steadily back to neutral.</p>

<p>They were racing over the field now.
She gave the elevators a slight upward pressure.
The wheels lifted clear, but the trees
at the edge of the lot were perilously near.
She knew that when a plane leaves the
ground its speed is not far above stalling
point. And with these trees so close, to
stall now would precipitate a bad crash--and
failure.</p>

<p>Dorothy, therefore, kept the nose level
for an instant or two, a dangerously short
instant, she feared. Back came her stick
again. The plane was climbing at last but
at a frightfully precipitous angle. Would
they make it? Would the throbbing engine
continue to function under the unaccustomed
strain?</p>

<p>Dorothy bit her lip. She eased off
slightly as the motor coughed; but pulled
the stick back almost immediately.</p>

<p>They were abreast the treetops now.--They
were over. But with a margin so
small that Dorothy was certain the wheels
had brushed the branches.</p>

<p>She eased their angle of ascent, but still
continued to climb. Then when she was
sure they were well above the crest of the
hill, she leveled off and banked to the left.</p>

<p>Once more she leveled off and turned
on the electrical mechanism which raised
the plane's landing gear.</p>

<p>Below her she could dimly make out the
gangster's farmhouse, the lake and the
stretch of ground between them. She
closed her throttle, pushing the stick forward
as she did so, and at the same time applied
right aileron and hard right rudder.</p>

<p>As the plane shot downward she neutralized
the elevators. Then did likewise
with her ailerons as the proper bank was
reached. Left aileron and hard left rudder
were next applied until the wings became
laterally level. Having completed a
beautiful half spiral, Dorothy landed the
amphibian on the little lake.</p>

<p>Her next move was an unusual one, but
on it depended the success or failure of her
plan.</p>

<p>With the airplane headed toward the
lake's low shore beyond which lay the
farmhouse, she turned the switch which
propelled the retractible landing gear
downward and into the water. Then she
opened the throttle for the last time.</p>

<p>There came a bump and a jar. The tail
tilted to a dangerous angle as the plane's
wheels struck the shallows. Would they
mire in the soft ground at the lake's edge
she wondered, and cause the big bus to
nose over and crash? But no--the plane,
after a sickening wrench, rolled free. It
glided over the sandy bank and on to the
grass.</p>

<p>Shutting off her engine, Dorothy permitted
her amphibian steed to come to a
stop at the porch steps, its ugly snout poked
almost up to the open doorway of the
house.</p>

<p>Dorothy had been too busy guiding her
bus to pay any attention to the reception
accorded her arrival. A shot or two had
been fired from the porch and she had
caught a glimpse of dark figures silhouetted
against the open doorway.</p>

<p>But now, as the slowing wheels struck
the steps, the porch was empty. The way
was clear for Mike's release. Together
they would find Bill and make a clean getaway
in the amphibian. What did it matter
if the gang made their escape? Her life
and the lives of her two friends were all
that counted now.</p>

<p>To speed the departing company she
turned the Browning into action and sent
half a belt of bullets whipping through
the door. But Dorothy aimed high. She
had no desire to play the part of executioner.</p>

<p>From her place in the cockpit she got
a good view of the front room. Mike, the
Scotland Yard detective, still sat bound to
his chair, but the others were streaking for
the back of the house. She could see them
tugging at the doors, which for some reason,
seemed to give them difficulty of exit.
Huddled at the far end of the room, they
clamored and struggled to get out of range.</p>

<p>Dorothy stopped firing and Bill Bolton
hobbled up the porch steps.</p>

<p>"Jumping Jupiter! girl, you're a
wonder!" he applauded. "Hold the
Browning on 'em. They can't get away.
I locked those doors from the outside.
Crawled through the wine cellar window
to do it," he panted. "Thought it might
embarrass them some--but this stunt of
yours makes it perfect."</p>

<p>He took a step forward and raised his
voice.</p>

<p>"Stick 'em up!" he cried. "Stick 'em
up--every one of you--that's better. Now
line up, facing the back wall--and remember--just
one bad break is all Miss
Dixon wants to rip off another belt--aimed
right, this time--" he added significantly.</p>

<p>As the gangsters scrambled to obey his
orders, Bill walked into the room and
Dorothy saw that his wrists were still handcuffed
behind his back.</p>

<p>"Who's got the handcuff key, Mr. Conway?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"Johnny, I believe," returned Mike
quietly.</p>

<p>"Johnny, have you the key?" This from
Bill.</p>

<p>"Y-yes, I got it."</p>

<p>"Got a gun?"</p>

<p>"N-no, sir, it's on the table."</p>

<p>"I'll take your word for it. Throw the
key over your shoulder, then stick up your
hands again."</p>

<p>Johnny complied with these demands,
and Bill picked up the key by sitting on
the floor and worming over to where it lay.</p>

<p>"Think you can turn this with your teeth,
Mr. Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>Mike nodded. Bill swung round and
lifted his hands as high as his bonds permitted.
The detective lowered his head
and got his teeth on the key. A moment
later there sounded a slight snap--and Bill
was free.</p>

<p>"Good job!" He worked his cramped
shoulders. "That certainly is a relief!"</p>

<p>He limped to the table, snatched a knife
and a couple of seconds later Mike was on
his feet. Without more ado they turned
to, and roped the gangsters one by one.</p>

<p>Dorothy got down from the plane and
came into the room.</p>

<p>"Who's going to stand guard while the
plane goes for the police?"</p>

<p>"Nobody," was Bill's answer. "We'll
pile the bunch in the bus and take them to
New Canaan ourselves. Gosh, there'll be
some big time in the town tonight, when
we arrive!"</p>

<p>"This morning, you mean," yawned
Dorothy. "It's getting light. And you
two may not know it, but I could go to
sleep standing up--and right now!"</p>

<p>"Brace up, kid! You're some aviatrix,
even though I did train you!"</p>

<p>"I'll second that--" beamed Mr.
Michael Conway, grasping her hand. "I
had a splendid view through the doorway--and
when that big bus hurled itself out of
the water like a hippo--and began to
charge the house, I--"</p>

<p>But Dorothy interrupted him with a
shake of her head and an involuntary
glance at Bill. "All I did was to take some
awful chances with Bill's property, Mr.
Conway."</p>

<p>"Ah--incidentally--saving my life, and
making the capture of this gang possible?"
smiled the detective. "You're a modest
young lady, indeed. But I suppose we'd
better be getting along--" and with a wave
of his hand, he added, "it may interest you
to know that the loot is in that kit bag under
the table."</p>

<p>"O.K. We'll attend to that," said Bill.</p>

<p>Then turning to Dorothy--"I'll say you
took some chances, young woman! How
about getting a plane of your own to fool
with from now on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bill! Do you think Daddy will
let me?"</p>

<p>"I know he will." Bill was serious now.
"After what you've done tonight, you've
certainly won your wings!"</p>
